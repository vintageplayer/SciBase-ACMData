We concentrate on sites that are representable by trees and assume that each leaf carries a weight representing its popularity.The problem of optimally adding at most one additional outgoing edge (\u201chotlink\u201d) to each inner node has been widely studied. A considerable number of approximation algorithms have been proposed and worst-case bounds for the quality of the computed solutions have been given. However, only little is known about the practical behavior of most of these algorithms.This article contributes to closing this gap by evaluating all recently proposed strategies experimentally. Our experiments are based on trees extracted from real Web sites, as well as on synthetic instances. The latter are generated by a new method that simulates the growth of a Web site over time.

With the availability of increasingly faster linear solvers, the speed of bipartite matching computations must keep up to avoid slowing down the main computation. Fast algorithms for bipartite matching, which are usually initialized with simple heuristics, have been known for a long time. However, the performance of these algorithms is largely dependent on the quality of the heuristic. We compare combinations of several known heuristics and exact algorithms to find fast combined methods, using real-world matrices as well as randomly generated instances. In addition, we present a new heuristic aimed at obtaining high-quality matchings and compare its impact on bipartite matching algorithms with that of other heuristics. The experiments suggest that its performance compares favorably to the best-known heuristics, and that it is especially suited for application in linear solvers.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456636789", "name": "johannes langguth"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81350600974", "name": "fredrik manne"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100534206", "name": "peter sanders"}], "citations": ["Lasse Kliemann, Matching in bipartite graph streams in a small number of passes, Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Experimental algorithms, May 05-07, 2011, Crete, Greece\n", "Bas O.

Many algorithms have been proposed to construct vertex cover in different contexts (offline, online, list algorithms, etc.) leading to solutions of different level of quality. This quality is traditionally measured in terms of approximation ratio, that is, the worst possible ratio between the quality of the solution constructed and the optimal one. For the vertex cover problem the range of such known ratios are between 2 (conjectured as being the smallest constant ratio) and \u0394, the maximum degree of the graph. Based on this measure of quality, the hierarchy is almost clear (the smaller the ratio is, the better the algorithm is).In this article, we show that this measure, although of great importance, is too macroscopic and does not reflect the practical behavior of the methods. We prove this by analyzing (known and recent) algorithms running on a particular class of graphs: the paths. We obtain closed and exact formulas for the mean of the sizes of vertex cover constructed by these different algorithms. Then, we assess their quality experimentally in several well-chosen class of graphs (random, regular, trees, BHOSLIB benchmarks, trap graphs, etc.). The synthesis of all these results lead us to formulate a \u201cpractical hierarchy\u201d of the algorithms. We remark that it is, more or less, the opposite to the one only based on approximation ratios, showing that worst-case analysis only gives partial information on the quality of an algorithm.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436595375", "name": "francois delbot"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100628811", "name": "christian laforest"}], "citations": ["Eric Angel , Romain Campigotto , Christian Laforest, Implementation and comparison of heuristics for the vertex cover problem on huge graphs, Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Experimental Algorithms, June 07-09, 2012, Bordeaux, France\n"]}, "Article No.: 1.5": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "1\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "14\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "254\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1671970.1883684", "references": ["Apostolico, A. 1985.

This index requires about 5 times the size of the compressed text (in theory, 4nHk(T)+o(nlog\u03c3) bits of space, whereHk(T) is thek-th order empirical entropy ofT). In practice, the average locating complexity of the LZ-index isO(\u03c3mlog\u03c3n+occ\u03c3m/2), whereoccis the number of occurrences ofP. It can extract text substrings of length &ell; inO(&ell;) time. This index outperforms competing schemes both to locate short patterns and to extract text snippets. However, the LZ-index can be up to 4 times larger than the smallest existing indices (which usenHk(T)+o(nlog\u03c3) bits in theory), and it does not offer space/time tuning options. This limits its applicability.In this article, we study practical ways to reduce the space of the LZ-index. We obtain new LZ-index variants that require 2(1+&epsis;)nHk(T) +o(nlog\u03c3) bits of space, for any 0<&epsis; <1. They have an average locating time ofO(1/&epsis;(mlogn+occ\u03c3m/2)), while extracting takesO(&ell;) time.We perform extensive experimentation and conclude that our schemes are able to reduce the space of the original LZ-index by a factor of 2/3, that is, around 3 times the compressed text size. Our schemes are able to extract about 1 to 2 MB of the text per second, being twice as fast as the most competitive alternatives. Pattern occurrences are located at a rate of up to 1 to 4 million per second. This constitutes the best space/time trade-off when indices are allowed to use 4 times the size of the compressed text or more.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384619073", "name": "diego arroyuelo"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100113887", "name": "gonzalo navarro"}], "citations": ["Diego Arroyuelo , Gonzalo Navarro, Space-efficient construction of Lempel-Ziv compressed text indexes, Information and Computation, v.209 n.7, p.1070-1102, July, 2011\n"]}, "Article No.: 1.6": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "5\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "297\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "22\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "634\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1671970.1921702", "references": ["Aardal, K.

The most efficient current data structures for this task are the hash table with move-to-front chains and the burst trie, both of which use linked lists as a substructure, and variants of binary search tree. These data structures are computationally efficient, but typical implementations use large numbers of nodes and pointers to manage strings, which is not efficient in use of cache. In this article, we explore two alternatives to the standard representation: the simple expedient of including the string in its node, and, for linked lists, the more drastic step of replacing each list of nodes by a contiguous array of characters. Our experiments show that, for large sets of strings, the improvement is dramatic. For hashing, in the best case the total space overhead is reduced to less than 1 bit per string. For the burst trie, over 300MB of strings can be stored in a total of under 200MB of memory with significantly improved search time. These results, on a variety of data sets, show that cache-friendly variants of fundamental data structures can yield remarkable gains in performance.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81333487435", "name": "nikolas askitis"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100029320", "name": "justin zobel"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 2.5": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "43\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "723\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1671970.1671978", "references": ["Aho, A., Hopcroft, J.

This approach has earlier been demonstrated to be efficient on modern cache-based processors [Sinha & Zobel, JEA 2004]. In this article, we introduce improvements that reduce by a significant margin the memory requirement of Burstsort: It is now less than 1&percnt; greater than an in-place algorithm. These techniques can be applied to existing variants of Burstsort, as well as other string algorithms such as for string management.We redesigned the buckets, introducing sub-buckets and an index structure for them, which resulted in an order-of-magnitude space reduction. We also show the practicality of moving some fields from the trie nodes to the insertion point (for the next string pointer) in the bucket; this technique reduces memory usage of the trie nodes by one-third. Importantly, the trade-off for the reduction in memory use is only a very slight increase in the running time of Burstsort on real-world string collections. In addition, during the bucket-sorting phase, the string suffixes are copied to a small buffer to improve their spatial locality, lowering the running time of Burstsort by up to 30&percnt;. These memory usage enhancements have enabled the copy-based approach [Sinha et al., JEA 2006] to also reduce the memory usage with negligible impact on speed.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332527852", "name": "ranjan sinha"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100261305", "name": "anthony wirth"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 2.4": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "38\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "747\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1671970.1671977", "references": ["Anurag Acharya , Huican Zhu , Kai Shen, Adaptive Algorithms for Cache-Efficient Trie Search, Selected papers from the International Workshop on Algorithm Engineering and Experimentation, p.296-311, January 15-16, 1999\n", "Andersson, A. and Nilsson, S. 1993.

We examine traditional comparison-based search trees as well as data structures that take advantage of the fact that the keys are integers such as van Emde Boas trees and various trie-based data structures. We propose a variant of a burst trie that performs better in time than all the alternative data structures. In addition, even for small sets of keys, this burst trie variant occupies less space than comparison-based data structures such as red-black trees andB-trees. Burst tries have previously been shown to provide a very efficient base for implementing cache efficient string sorting algorithms. We find that with suitable engineering, they also perform excellently as a dynamic ordered data structure operating over integer keys. We provide experimental results when the data structures operate over uniform random data.

In this article, we present a new approach for upward crossing minimization, that is, finding an upward drawing of a DAGGwith as few crossings as possible. Our algorithm is based on a two-stage upward planarization approach, which computes a feasible upward planar subgraph in the first step and reinserts the remaining arcs by computing constraint-feasible upward insertion paths. An experimental study shows that the new algorithm leads to much better results than existing algorithms for upward crossing minimization, including the classical Sugiyama approach.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100362708", "name": "markus chimani"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100631837", "name": "carsten gutwenger"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100113884", "name": "petra mutzel"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81456611866", "name": "hoi-ming wong"}], "citations": ["Markus Chimani , Philipp Hungerl\u00e4nder , Michael J\u00fcnger , Petra Mutzel, An SDP approach to multi-level crossing minimization, Proceedings of the Meeting on Algorithm Engineering & Expermiments, p.116-126, January 22-22, 2011, San Francisco, California\n", "Gregor Betz , Christoph Doll , Andreas Gemsa , Ignaz Rutter , Dorothea Wagner, Column-Based graph layouts, Proceedings of the 20th international conference on Graph Drawing, September 19-21, 2012, Redmond, WA\n", "Markus Chimani , Philipp Hungerl\u00e4nder , Michael J\u00fcnger , Petra Mutzel, An SDP approach to multi-level crossing minimization, Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), 17, 2012\n", "Markus Chimani , Robert Zeranski, Upward Planarity Testing in Practice: SAT Formulations and Comparative Study, Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), 20, May 2015\n", "Markus Chimani , Carsten Gutwenger , Petra Mutzel , Miro Sp\u00f6nemann , Hoi-Ming Wong, Crossing minimization and layouts of directed hypergraphs with port constraints, Proceedings of the 18th international conference on Graph drawing, September 21-24, 2010, Konstanz, Germany\n", "Markus Chimani , Robert Zeranski, Upward planarity testing via SAT, Proceedings of the 20th international conference on Graph Drawing, September 19-21, 2012, Redmond, WA\n", "Christian Bachmaier , Wolfgang Brunner , Andreas Glei\u00dfner, Grid sifting: Leveling and crossing reduction, Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), 17, 2012\n", "Markus Chimani , Robert Zeranski, An exact approach to upward crossing minimization, Proceedings of the Meeting on Algorithm Engineering & Expermiments, p.73-85, January 05-05, 2014, Portland, Oregon\n"]}, "Article No.: 2.1": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "7\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "209\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1671970.1671974", "references": [], "title": "Preface", "affiliation_data": [], "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100541599", "name": "catherine c mcgeoch"}], "citations": []}}}}, "Volume14,": {"Issue1": {"date": {"year": "2009", "month": 0}, "articles": {"Article No.: 5": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "5\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "56\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "654\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1498698.1594231", "references": ["Umut A.

We quantify their strengths and weaknesses through tests with various workloads, most stemming from practical applications. We observe that a simple, linear-time implementation is remarkably fast for graphs of small diameter, and that worst-case and randomized data structures are best when queries are very frequent.

As a consequence, we get a more flexible trade-off between false-positive rate, space-efficiency, cache-efficiency, hash-efficiency, and computational effort. We analyze the efficiency of Bloom filters and the proposed replacements in detail, in terms of the false-positive rate, the number of expected cache-misses, and the number of required hash bits.

Unfortunately, when it comes to implementing those algorithms and applying them to real genomic sequences, often the main memory size becomes the bottleneck. This is easily explained by the fact that while a DNA sequence of lengthnfrom alphabet \u03a3 &equals; {A,C,G,T} can be stored innlog &verbar;\u03a3&verbar; &equlas; 2nbits, its suffix tree occupiesO(nlogn) bits. In practice, the size difference easily reaches factor 50.We report on an implementation of the compressed suffix tree very recently proposed by Sadakane (2007). The compressed suffix tree occupies space proportional to the text size, that is,O(nlog &verbar;\u03a3&verbar;) bits, and supports all typical suffix tree operations with at most lognfactor slowdown. Our experiments show that, for example, on a 10 MB DNA sequence, the compressed suffix tree takes 10&percnt; of the space of the normal suffix tree. At the same time, a representative algorithm is slowed down by factor 30.Our implementation follows the original proposal in spirit, but some internal parts are tailored toward practical implementation. Our construction algorithm has time requirementO(nlognlog &verbar;\u03a3&verbar;) and uses closely the same space as the final structure while constructing it: on the 10MB DNA sequence, the maximum space usage during construction is only 1.5 times the final product size. As by-products, we develop a method to createSuccinct Suffix Arraydirectly from Burrows-Wheeler transform and a space-efficient version of the suffixes-insertion algorithm to build balanced parentheses representation of suffix tree from LCP information.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326493428", "name": "n valimaki"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100185693", "name": "v makinen"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326489226", "name": "w gerlach"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326489023", "name": "k dixit"}], "citations": ["Enno Ohlebusch , Johannes Fischer , Simon Gog, CST++, Proceedings of the 17th international conference on String processing and information retrieval, October 11-13, 2010, Los Cabos, Mexico\n", "Masaya Nakahara , Shirou Maruyama , Tetsuji Kuboyama , Hiroshi Sakamoto, Scalable detection of frequent substrings by grammar-based compression, Proceedings of the 14th international conference on Discovery science, p.236-246, October 05-07, 2011, Espoo, Finland\n", "Susana Ladra , Oscar Pedreira , Jose Duato , Nieves R.

The lookup is a nontrivial operation, since it requires searching for the longest prefix, among those stored in a (large) given table, matching the IP address. Ever increasing routing table size, traffic volume, and links speed demand new and more efficient algorithms. Moreover, the imminent move to IPv6 128-bit addresses will soon require a rethinking of previous technical choices. This article describes a the new data structure for solving the IP table lookup problem christened the adaptive stratified tree (AST). The proposed solution is based on casting the problem in geometric terms and on repeated application of efficient local geometric optimization routines. Experiments with this approach have shown that in terms of storage, query time, and update time the AST is at a par with state of the art algorithms based on data compression or string manipulations (and often it is better on some of the measured quantities).", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100438077", "name": "marco pellegrini"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416598158", "name": "giordano fusco"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 1.5": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "14\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "19\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "713\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1227161.1322337", "references": ["P.

Although promising, the metric space approach is still immature in several aspects that are well established in traditional databases. In particular, most indexing schemes are static, that is, few of them tolerate insertion or deletion of elements at reasonable cost over an existing index. The spatial approximation tree (sa--tree) has been experimentally shown to provide a good tradeoff between construction cost, search cost, and space requirement. However, thesa--treeis static, which renders it unsuitable for many database applications. In this paper, we study different methods to handle insertions and deletions on thesa--treeat low cost. In many cases, the dynamic construction (by successive insertions) is even faster than the previous static construction, and both are similar elsewhere. In addition, the dynamic version significantly improves the search performance ofsa--treesin virtually all cases. The result is a much more practical data structure that can be useful in a wide range of database applications.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100113887", "name": "gonzalo navarro"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100612390", "name": "nora reyes"}], "citations": ["Gonzalo Navarro , Nora Reyes, Dynamic Spatial Approximation Trees for Massive Data, Proceedings of the 2009 Second International Workshop on Similarity Search and Applications, p.81-88, August 29-30, 2009, Prague, Czech Republic\n", "Dashiell Kolbe , Qiang Zhu , Sakti Pramanik, k-Nearest neighbor searching in hybrid spaces, Information Systems, v.43 n.C, p.55-64, July 2014\n", "Roberto Uribe Paredes , Gonzalo Navarro, EGNAT: A Fully Dynamic Metric Access Method for Secondary Memory, Proceedings of the 2009 Second International Workshop on Similarity Search and Applications, p.57-64, August 29-30, 2009, Prague, Czech Republic\n", "Bilegsaikhan Naidan , Magnus Lie Hetland, Static-to-Dynamic transformation for metric indexing structures, Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Similarity Search and Applications, August 09-10, 2012, Toronto, ON, Canada\n", "Gonzalo Navarro , Roberto Uribe-Paredes, Fully dynamic metric access methods based on hyperplane partitioning, Information Systems, v.36 n.4, p.734-747, June, 2011\n", "Marcelo Barroso , Nora Reyes , Rodrigo Paredes, Enlarging nodes to improve dynamic spatial approximation trees, Proceedings of the Third International Conference on SImilarity Search and APplications, September 18-19, 2010, Istanbul, Turkey\n", "Hisashi Kurasawa , Atsuhiro Takasu , Jun Adachi, Finding the k-closest pairs in metric spaces, Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on New Trends in Similarity Search, March 25-25, 2011, Uppsala, Sweden\n", "Aureo Serrano , Luisa Mic\u00f3 , Jose Oncina, Impact of the initialization in tree-based fast similarity search techniques, Proceedings of the First international conference on Similarity-based pattern recognition, September 28-30, 2011, Venice, Italy\n", "Luisa Mic\u00f3 , Jose Oncina, Experimental Analysis of Insertion Costs in a Na\u00efve Dynamic MDF-Tree, Proceedings of the 4th Iberian Conference on Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis, June 10-12, 2009, P\u00f3voa de Varzim, Portugal\n", "Luis Britos , A.

Many good algorithms are known which offer various trade-offs in efficiency, simplicity, memory use, and other factors. However, these algorithms do not take into account features of modern computer architectures that significantly influence performance. Caches and branch predictors are two such features and, while there has been a significant amount of research into the cache performance of general purpose sorting algorithms, there has been little research on their branch prediction properties. In this paper, we empirically examine the behavior of the branches in all the most common sorting algorithms. We also consider the interaction of cache optimization on the predictability of the branches in these algorithms. We find insertion sort to have the fewest branch mispredictions of any comparison-based sorting algorithm, that bubble and shaker sort operate in a fashion that makes their branches highly unpredictable, that the unpredictability of shellsort's branches improves its caching behavior, and that several cache optimizations have little effect on mergesort's branch mispredictions. We find also that optimizations to quicksort, for example the choice of pivot, have a strong influence on the predictability of its branches. We point out a simple way of removing branch instructions from a classic heapsort implementation and also show that unrolling a loop in a cache-optimized heapsort implementation improves the predicitability of its branches. Finally, we note that when sorting random data two-level adaptive branch predictors are usually no better than simpler bimodal predictors. This is despite the fact that two-level adaptive predictors are almost always superior to bimodal predictors, in general.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418597055", "name": "paul biggar"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388600663", "name": "nicholas nash"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100004881", "name": "kevin williams"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100422211", "name": "david gregg"}], "citations": ["Amr Elmasry , Jyrki Katajainen , Max Stenmark, Branch mispredictions don't affect mergesort, Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Experimental Algorithms, June 07-09, 2012, Bordeaux, France\n", "Conrado Mart\u00ednez , Markus E.

Consider a grid terrainTand letCbe a cost grid forTsuch that every point inCstores a value that represents the cost of traversing the corresponding point inT. GivenCand a set of sourcesS\u2208T, a least-cost-path grid \u0394 forTis a grid such that every point in \u0394 represents the distance to the source inSthat can be reached with minimal cost. We present a scalable approach to computing least-cost-path grids. Our algorithm, terracost, is derived from our previous work on I/O-efficient shortest paths on grids and usesO(sort(n)) I/Os, where sort(n) is the complexity of sortingnitems of data in the I/O-model of Aggarwal and Vitter. We present the design, the analysis, and an experimental study of terracost. An added benefit of the algorithm underlying terracost is that it naturally lends itself to parallelization. We have implemented terracost in a distributed environment using our cluster management tool and report on experiments that show that it obtains speedup near-linear with the size of the cluster. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental evaluation of a multiple-source least-cost-path algorithm in the external memory setting.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81314494055", "name": "thomas hazel"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100415659", "name": "laura toma"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100502961", "name": "jan vahrenhold"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100254863", "name": "rajiv wickremesinghe"}], "citations": ["Vishal Verma , Jack Snoeyink, Reducing the memory required to find a geodesic shortest path on a large mesh, Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, November 04-06, 2009, Seattle, Washington\n"]}, "Article No.: 2.5": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "1\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "18\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "680\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1227161.1227167", "references": ["Arnborg, S., Lagergren, J., and Seese, D. 1991.

Word and coauthors from the Richardsons' 3D Protein Structure laboratory at Duke University proposedot scoresto measure interatomic interactions in molecular structures. Their program REDUCE uses these scores in a brute-force search to solve instances of theNP-hard problem of finding the optimal placement of hydrogen atoms in molecular structures determined by X-ray crystallography. We capture the central combinatorial optimization in the hydrogen placement problem with an abstraction that we call an interaction (hyper)graph. REDUCE's dot-based scoring function cannot be decomposed into the sum of pair interactions, but because the function is short ranged we are able to decompose it into the sum of single, pair, triple, and quadruple interactions that we represent by graph hyperedges. Almost every interaction graph we have observed has had a small treewidth. This fact allows us to replace the brute-force search by dynamic programming, giving speedups of nearly ten orders of magnitude. This dynamic programming has been incorporated into REDUCE and is available for download.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367596084", "name": "andrew leaver-fay"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326490914", "name": "yuanxin liu"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100047211", "name": "jack snoeyink"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81414605137", "name": "xueyi wang"}], "citations": ["Hans L.

In thetime-expandedapproach, every event at a station, e.g., the departure of a train, is modeled as a node in the graph, while in thetime-dependentapproach the graph contains only one node per station. Both approaches have been recently considered for (a simplified version of) the earliest arrival problem, but little is known about their relative performance. Thus far, there are only theoretical arguments in favor of the time-dependent approach. In this paper, we provide the first extensive experimental comparison of the two approaches. Using several real-world data sets, we evaluate the performance of the basic models and of several new extensions towards realistic modeling. Furthermore, new insights on solving bicriteria optimization problems in both models are presented. The time-expanded approach turns out to be more robust for modeling more complex scenarios, whereas the time-dependent approach shows a clearly better performance.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81326491964", "name": "evangelia pyrga"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100314466", "name": "frank schulz"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100168505", "name": "dorothea wagner"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100121089", "name": "christos zaroliagis"}], "citations": ["Yann Disser , Matthias M\u00fcller-Hannemann , Mathias Schnee, Multi-criteria shortest paths in time-dependent train networks, Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Experimental algorithms, p.347-361, May 30-June 01, 2008, Provincetown, MA, USA\n", "Daniel Delling, Time-Dependent SHARC-Routing, Proceedings of the 16th annual European symposium on Algorithms, September 15-17, 2008, Karlsruhe, Germany\n", "Daniel Delling , Dorothea Wagner, Pareto Paths with SHARC, Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms, p.125-136, June 04-06, 2009, Dortmund, Germany\n", "Ander Garcia , Olatz Arbelaitz , Pieter Vansteenwegen , Wouter Souffriau , Maria Teresa Linaza, Hybrid approach for the public transportation time dependent orienteering problem with time windows, Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems, p.151-158, June 23-25, 2010, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain\n", "Robert Geisberger, Contraction of timetable networks with realistic transfers, Proceedings of the 9th international conference on Experimental Algorithms, May 20-22, 2010, Naples, Italy\n", "Hannah Bast , Erik Carlsson , Arno Eigenwillig , Robert Geisberger , Chris Harrelson , Veselin Raychev , Fabien Viger, Fast routing in very large public transportation networks using transfer patterns, Proceedings of the 18th annual European conference on Algorithms: Part I, September 06-08, 2010, Liverpool, UK\n", "Hannah Bast , Sabine Storandt, Frequency-based search for public transit, Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, November 04-07, 2014, Dallas, Texas\n", "Hoang Tam Vo, Enabling Smart Transit with Real-time Trip Planning, Proceedings of the ACM First International Workshop on Understanding the City with Urban Informatics, October 19-19, 2015, Melbourne, Australia\n", "Annabell Berger , Matthias M\u00fcller-Hannemann , Steffen Rechner , Alexander Zock, Efficient computation of time-dependent centralities in air transportation networks, Proceedings of the 5th international conference on WALCOM: algorithms and computation, February 18-20, 2011, New Delhi, India\n", "Virginia Vassilevska, Nondecreasing paths in a weighted graph or: how to optimally read a train schedule, Proceedings of the nineteenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms, p.465-472, January 20-22, 2008, San Francisco, California\n", "Dominik Kirchler , Leo Liberti , Roberto Wolfler Calvo, A label correcting algorithm for the shortest path problem on a multi-modal route network, Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Experimental Algorithms, June 07-09, 2012, Bordeaux, France\n", "Jolanta Koszelew , Krzysztof Ostrowski, A memetic algorithm for routing in urban public transportation networks, Proceedings of the Second international conference on Adaptive and intelligent systems, September 06-08, 2011, Klagenfurt, Austria\n", "Ben Strasser , Dorothea Wagner, Connection scan accelerated, Proceedings of the Meeting on Algorithm Engineering & Expermiments, p.125-137, January 05-05, 2014, Portland, Oregon\n", "Damianos Gavalas , Charalampos Konstantopoulos , Konstantinos Mastakas , Grammati Pantziou , Nikolaos Vathis, Heuristics for the time dependent team orienteering problem, Computers and Operations Research, v.62 n.C, p.36-50, October 2015\n", "Ander Garcia , Olatz Arbelaitz , Maria Teresa Linaza , Pieter Vansteenwegen , Wouter Souffriau, Personalized tourist route generation, Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Current trends in web engineering, July 05-06, 2010, Vienna, Austria\n", "Ander Garcia , Pieter Vansteenwegen , Olatz Arbelaitz , Wouter Souffriau , Maria Teresa Linaza, Integrating public transportation in personalised electronic tourist guides, Computers and Operations Research, v.40 n.3, p.758-774, March, 2013\n", "Daniel Delling , Thomas Pajor , Renato F.

First, we show the results of experiments from two new variants of the SS algorithm. The first variant, which runs in timeO(n&sqrt;BlogB), appears to have almost identical expected waste as the sum-of-squares algorithm on all the distributions mentioned in the original papers on this topic. The other variant, which runs inO(nlogB) time, performs well on most, but not on all of those distributions. We also apply SS to the online memory-allocation problem. Our experimental comparisons between SS and Best Fit indicate that neither algorithm is consistently better than the other. If the amount of randomness in item sizes is low, SS appears to have lower waste than Best Fit, whereas, if the amount of randomness is high Best Fit appears to have lower waste than SS. Our experiments suggest that in both real and synthetic traces, SS does not seem to have an asymptotic advantage over Best Fit, in contrast with the bin-packing problem.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100458566", "name": "michael a bender"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367594419", "name": "bryan bradley"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100208712", "name": "geetha jagannathan"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100451415", "name": "krishnan pillaipakkamnatt"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 2.2": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "10\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "63\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "12\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "1975\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1227161.1227164", "references": ["Pankaj K.

We investigate by empirical methods a number of implementation issues and parameter choices for the cache-oblivious sorting algorithm Lazy Funnelsort and compare the final algorithm with Quicksort, the established standard for comparison-based sorting, as well as with recent cache-aware proposals. The main result is a carefully implemented cache-oblivious sorting algorithm, which, our experiments show, can be faster than the best Quicksort implementation we are able to find for input sizes well within the limits of RAM. It is also at least as fast as the recent cache-aware implementations included in the test. On disk, the difference is even more pronounced regarding Quicksort and the cache-aware algorithms, whereas the algorithm is slower than a careful implementation of multiway Mergesort, such as TPIE.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594931", "name": "gerth stlting brodal"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100166398", "name": "rolf fagerberg"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367598261", "name": "kristoffer vinther"}], "citations": ["Catherine C.

In the mathematical model pioneered by Sankoff and others, a unichromosomal genome is represented by a signed permutation of a multiset of genes; Hannenhalli and Pevzner showed that the edit distance between two signed permutations of the same set can be computed in polynomial time when all operations are inversions. El-Mabrouk extended that result to allow deletions and a limited form of insertions (which forbids duplications); in turn we extended it to compute a nearly optimal edit sequence between an arbitrary genome and the identity permutation. In this paper we generalize our approach to compute distances between two arbitrary genomes, but focus on approximating the true evolutionary distance rather than the edit distance. We present experimental results showing that our algorithm produces excellent estimates of the true evolutionary distance up to a (high) threshold of saturation; indeed, the distances thus produced are good enough to enable the simple neighbor-joining procedure to reconstruct our test trees with high accuracy.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100389303", "name": "krister m swenson"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100540567", "name": "mark marron"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367598842", "name": "joel v earnest-deyoung"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100188776", "name": "bernard m e moret"}], "citations": ["Laurent Bulteau , Christian Komusiewicz, Minimum common string partition parameterized by partition size is fixed-parameter tractable, Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, p.102-121, January 05-07, 2014, Portland, Oregon\n", "Matthias Bernt , Ming-Chiang Chen , Daniel Merkle , Hung-Lung Wang , Kun-Mao Chao , Martin Middendorf, Finding All Sorting Tandem Duplication Random Loss Operations, Proceedings of the 20th Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Pattern Matching, p.301-313, June 22-24, 2009, Lille, France\n", "Matthias Bernt , Kuan-Yu Chen , Ming-Chiang Chen , An-Chiang Chu , Daniel Merkle , Hung-Lung Wang , Kun-Mao Chao , Martin Middendorf, Finding all sorting tandem duplication random loss operations, Journal of Discrete Algorithms, v.9 n.1, p.32-48, March, 2011\n"]}, "Article No.: 3.2": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "3\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "50\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "619\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1227161.1402294", "references": ["Jon L.

Many variants have been developed, the best of which are among the fastest generic-sorting algorithms available, as testified by the choice of Quicksort as the default sorting algorithm in most programming libraries. Some sorting algorithms are adaptive, i.e., they have a complexity analysis that is better for inputs, which are nearly sorted, according to some specified measure of presortedness. Quicksort is not among these, as it uses \u03a9(nlogn) comparisons even for sorted inputs. However, in this paper, we demonstrate empirically that the actual running time of Quicksortisadaptive with respect to the presortedness measure Inv. Differences close to a factor of two are observed between instances with low and high Inv value. We then show that for the randomized version of Quicksort, the number of elementswapsperformed isprovablyadaptive with respect to the measure Inv. More precisely, we prove that randomized Quicksort performs expectedO(n(1 + log(1 + Inv/n))) element swaps, where Inv denotes the number of inversions in the input sequence. This result provides a theoretical explanation for the observed behavior and gives new insights on the behavior of Quicksort. We also give some empirical results on the adaptive behavior of Heapsort and Mergesort.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81409594931", "name": "gerth stlting brodal"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100166398", "name": "rolf fagerberg"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81367593590", "name": "gabriel moruz"}], "citations": ["Stefan Edelkamp , Amr Elmasry , Jyrki Katajainen, Two constant-factor-optimal realizations of adaptive heapsort, Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on Combinatorial Algorithms, p.195-208, July 20-22, 2011, Vancouver, BC, Canada\n", "Sebastian Wild , Markus Nebel , Raphael Reitzig , Ulrich Laube, Engineering Java 7's dual pivot quicksort using MaLiJAn: adventures with just-in-time compilation, Proceedings of the Meeting on Algorithm Engineering & Expermiments, p.55-69, January 07-07, 2013, New Orleans, Louisiana\n", "Stefan Edelkamp , Amr Elmasry , Jyrki Katajainen, The weak-heap data structure: Variants and applications, Journal of Discrete Algorithms, 16, p.187-205, October, 2012\n"]}, "Article No.: 3.3": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "2\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "13\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "275\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1227161.1402295", "references": ["Arrow, K. and Debreu, G. 1954.

Such activity led to a flurry of polynomial time algorithms for various restricted, yet significant, settings. The most important restrictions arise either when the traders' utility functions satisfy a property known asgross substitutabilityor when the initial endowments are proportional (the Fisher model). In this paper, we experimentally compare the performance of some of these recent algorithms against that of the most used software packages. In particular, we evaluate the following approaches: (1) the solver PATH, available under GAMS/MPSGE, a popular tool for computing market equilibrium prices; (2) a discrete version of a simple iterative price update scheme called t\u00e2tonnement; (3) a discrete version of the welfare adjustment process; (4) convex feasibility programs that characterize the equilibrium in some special cases. We analyze the performance of these approaches on models of exchange economies where the consumers are equipped with utility functions, which are widely used in real world applications. The outcomes of our experiments consistently show that many market settings allow for an efficient computation of the equilibrium, well beyond the restrictions under which the theory provides polynomial time guarantees. For some of the approaches, we also identify models where they are are prone to failure.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100285265", "name": "bruno codenotti"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100215518", "name": "benton mccune"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100583465", "name": "sriram pemmaraju"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548725156", "name": "rajiv raman"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100297766", "name": "kasturi varadarajan"}], "citations": ["Bruno Codenotti , Benton Mccune , Sriram Pemmaraju , Rajiv Raman , Kasturi Varadarajan, An experimental study of different approaches to solve the market equilibrium problem, Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), 12, 2008\n", "Eduardo R.

At the top level, a hash function is used to partition the keys to be stored into several sets. On the second level, there is a perfect hash function for each of these sets. This technique guaranteesO(1) worst-case time for lookup and expectedO(1) amortized time for insertion and deletion, while only linear space is required. We study the practical performance of dynamic perfect hashing and describe improvements of the basic scheme. The focus is on the choice of the hash function (both for integer and string keys), on the efficiency of rehashing, on the handling of small buckets, and on the space requirements of the implementation.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100304582", "name": "martin dietzfelbinger"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100324321", "name": "martin huhne"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330500450", "name": "christoph weidling"}], "citations": ["Nicholas Nash , David Gregg, Comparing integer data structures for 32- and 64-bit keys, Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), 15, 2010\n"]}, "Article No.: 3.4": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "26\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "37\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "594\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1227161.1402296", "references": ["Mohamed Ibrahim Abouelhoda , Stefan Kurtz , Enno Ohlebusch, The Enhanced Suffix Array and Its Applications to Genome Analysis, Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics, p.449-463, September 17-21, 2002\n", "Alok Aggarwal , Jeffrey,S.

It is sensitive to the compressibility of the text andlocal, meaning that random portions of the suffix array can be decompressed by accessing mostly contiguous memory areas. This makes decompression very fast, especially when various contiguous cells must be accessed.Our main technical contributions are the following. First, we show that runs of consecutive values that are known to appear in function \u03a8(i) &equals;A\u22121[A[i] &plus; 1] of suffix arraysAof compressible texts also show up as repetitions in the differential suffix arrayA'[i] &equals;A[i] \u2212A[i\u22121]. Second, we use Re-Pair, a grammar-based compressor, to compress the differential suffix array, and upper bound its compression ratio in terms of the number of runs. Third, we show how to compact the space used by the grammar rules by up to 50&percnt;, while still permitting direct access to the rules. Fourth, we develop specific variants of Re-Pair that work using knowledge of \u03a8, and use much less space than the general Re-Pair compressor, while achieving almost the same compression ratios. Fifth, we implement the scheme and compare it exhaustively with previous work, including the first implementations of previous theoretical proposals.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388596990", "name": "rodrigo gonzalez"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100113887", "name": "gonzalo navarro"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=89558812657", "name": "hector ferrada"}], "citations": ["Simon Gog , Gonzalo Navarro , Matthias Petri, Improved and extended locating functionality on compressed suffix arrays, Journal of Discrete Algorithms, v.32 n.C, p.53-63, May 2015\n"]}, "Article No.: 1.2": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "70\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "174\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2594409", "references": ["A.

We propose a characterization of the SAT problem as a physical system, using both quantum and classical statistical-physical models. We associate a graph to an SAT instance and we prove that a Bose-Einstein condensation occurs in the instance with higher probability if the quantum distribution is adopted in the generation of the graph. Conversely, the fit-get-rich behavior is more likely if we adopt the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Our method allows a comprehensive analysis of the SAT problem based on a new definition of entropy of an instance, without requiring the computation of its truth assignments. The entropy of an SAT instance increases in the satisfiability region as the number of free variables in the instance increases. Finally, we develop six new solvers for the MaxSAT problem based on quantum and classical statistical distributions, and we test them on random SAT instances, with competitive results. We experimentally prove that the performance of the solvers based on the two distributions depends on the criterion used to flag clauses as satisfied in the SAT solving process.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81550660256", "name": "claudio angione"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658635135", "name": "annalisa occhipinti"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100579435", "name": "giuseppe nicosia"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 1.5": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "98\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "98\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2630068", "references": ["D.

Many variants of this problem, which we generically refer to as the rearrangement sorting problem, have been tackled in the literature, and for most of them, the best known algorithms are approximations or heuristics. In this article, we present a tool, calledGRAAu, to aid in the evaluation of the results produced by these algorithms. To illustrate its application, we use GRAAu to evaluate the results of four approximation algorithms regarding two variants of the rearrangement sorting problem: the problem of sorting by prefix reversals and the problem of sorting by prefix transpositions. As a result, we show that the approximation ratios of three algorithms are tight and conjecture that the approximation ratio of the remaining one is also tight.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81485655433", "name": "gustavo rodrigues galvao"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100518303", "name": "zanoni dias"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 2.7": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "81\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "116\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2674395", "references": ["Ittai Abraham , Daniel Delling , Amos Fiat , Andrew V.

In this article, we focus on efficient implementations for the OnOPT class described in Moruz and Negoescu [2012], particularly on an algorithm in this class, denotedRDM, that was shown to typically incur fewer misses than LRU. We provide experimental evidence on a wide range of cache traces showing that our implementation of RDM is competitive to LRU with respect to runtime.

The collection is available beforehand so that a data structure, called an index, can be built on it to speed up queries. While initially restricted to natural language text collections, document retrieval problems arise nowadays in applications like bioinformatics, multimedia databases, and web mining. This requires a more general setup where text and pattern can be general sequences of symbols, and the classical inverted indexes developed for words cannot be applied. While linear-space time-optimal solutions have been developed for most interesting queries in this general case, space usage is a serious problem in practice.In this article, we develop compact data structures that solve various important document retrieval problems on general text collections. More specifically, we provide practical solutions for listing the documents where a query pattern appears, together with its frequency in each document, and for listingkdocuments where a query pattern appears most frequently. Some of our techniques build on existing theoretical proposals, while others are new. In particular, we introduce a novel grammar-based compressed bitmap representation that may be of independent interest when dealing with repetitive sequences.Ours are the first practical indexes that use less space when the text collection is compressible. Our experimental results show that, in various real-life text collections, our data structures are significantly smaller than the most space-efficient previous solutions, using up to half the space without noticeably increasing the query time. Overall, document listing can be carried out in 10 to 40 milliseconds for patterns that appear 100 to 10,000 times in the collection, whereas top-kretrieval is carried out inkto 10kmilliseconds.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100113887", "name": "gonzalo navarro"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100272116", "name": "simon j puglisi"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487654428", "name": "daniel valenzuela"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 2.2": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "97\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "9\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "140\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2670338", "references": ["D.

Today, multilevel strategies represent one of the most effective and efficient generic frameworks for solving this problem on large-scale graphs. Most of the attention in designing multilevel partitioning frameworks has been on the refinement phase. In this work, we focus on the coarsening phase, which is responsible for creating structures similar to the original but smaller graphs. We compare different matching- and AMG-based coarsening schemes, experiment with the algebraic distance between nodes, and demonstrate computational results on several classes of graphs that emphasize the running time and quality advantages of different coarsening schemes.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453647047", "name": "ilya safro"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100534206", "name": "peter sanders"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548009675", "name": "christian schulz"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 2.1": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "26\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "37\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2677196", "references": [], "title": "Editorial", "affiliation_data": [{"affiliation": "cnrs - labri - universite de bordeaux", "name": "ralf klasing"}], "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658677007", "name": "ralf klasing"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 3.2": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "137\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "18\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "137\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2699886", "references": ["Ittai Abraham, Daniel Delling, Andrew V.

The main challenge is that a seemingly optimal journey may have changes between networks that do not reflect the user\u2019s modal preferences. In fact, quickly computing reasonable multimodal routes remains a challenging problem: previous approaches either suffer from poor query performance or their available choices of modal preferences during query time is limited. In this work, we focus on computing exact multimodal journeys that can be restricted by specifyingarbitrarymodal sequences at query time. For example, a user can say whether he or she wants to only use public transit, prefers to also use a taxi or walking at the beginning or end of the journey, or has no restrictions at all. By carefully adapting node contraction, a common ingredient to many speedup techniques on road networks, we are able to compute point-to-point queries on a continental network combined of cars, railroads, and flights several orders of magnitude faster than Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm. Thereby, we require little space overhead and obtain fast preprocessing times.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158727557", "name": "julian dibbelt"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453654046", "name": "thomas pajor"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100168505", "name": "dorothea wagner"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 3.3": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "78\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "157\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2638551", "references": ["Alex Arenas. 2009.

Formalizations of this notion lead to measures that quantify the quality of a clustering and to algorithms that actually find clusterings. Since, most generally, corresponding optimization problems are hard, heuristic clustering algorithms are used in practice, or other approaches that are not based on an objective function. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the qualitative behavior of greedy bottom-up heuristics driven by cut-based objectives and constrained by intracluster density, using both real-world data and artificial instances. Our study documents that a greedy strategy based on local movement is superior to one based on merging. We further reveal that the former approach generally outperforms alternative setups and reference algorithms from the literature in terms of its own objective, while a modularity-based algorithm competes surprisingly well. Finally, we exhibit which combinations of cut-based inter- and intracluster measures are suitable for identifying a hidden reference clustering in synthetic random graphs and discuss the skewness of the resulting cluster size distributions. Our results serve as a guideline to the usage of bicriterial, cut-based measures for graph clusterings.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384592403", "name": "robert gorke"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658635516", "name": "andrea kappes"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100168505", "name": "dorothea wagner"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 3.1": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "31\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "31\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2721893", "references": [], "title": "Introduction to Special Issue ALENEX'12", "affiliation_data": [{"affiliation": "georgia institute of technology usa", "name": "david a bader"}, {"affiliation": "technische universitat dortmund germany", "name": "petra mutzel"}], "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658699008", "name": "david a bader"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100113884", "name": "petra mutzel"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 3.4": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "88\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "143\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2656332", "references": ["Anurag Acharya, Huican Zhu, and Kai Shen. 1999.

More than 50 years of usage have produced many variants and implementations to overcome some of their limitations. We explore new succinct representations of path-decomposed tries and experimentally evaluate the corresponding reduction in space usage and memory latency, comparing with the state of the art. We study the following applications: compressed string dictionary and monotone minimal perfect hash for strings.In compressed string dictionary, we obtain data structures that outperform other state-of-the-art compressed dictionaries in space efficiency while obtaining predictable query times that are competitive with data structures preferred by the practitioners. On real-world datasets, our compressed tries obtain the smallest space (except for one case) and have the fastest lookup times, whereas access times are within 20&percnt; slower than the best-known solutions.In monotone minimal perfect hash for strings, our compressed tries perform several times faster than other trie-based monotone perfect hash functions while occupying nearly the same space.

We then present empirical results arising from experiments on the real datasets that stem from these matching runs, with the aim of establishing the extent to which the particular optimality criteria that are present in the UK influence the structure of the solutions that are ultimately computed.

This way, we can model periodic congestions during rush hour and similar effects. In this work we deal with the special case where edge weights are time-dependent travel times. Namely, we consider two problems in this setting: Earliest arrival queries ask for a minimum travel time route for a start and a destination depending on a given departure time. Travel time profile queries ask for the travel time profile for a start, a destination, and an interval of possible departure times. For an instance representing the German road network, for example, we can answer earliest arrival queries in less than 1.5ms. For travel time profile queries, which are much harder to answer, we need less than 40ms if the interval of possible departure times has a width of 24 hours. For inexact travel time profiles with an allowed error of about 1&percnt; this even reduces to 3.2ms. The underlying hierarchical representations of the road network, which are variants of a time-dependent contraction hierarchy (TCH), need less than 1GiB of space and can be generated in about 30 minutes. As far as we know, TCHs are currently the only method being able to answer travel time profile queries efficiently. Altogether, with TCHs, web servers with massive request traffic are able to provide fast time-dependent earliest arrival route planning and computation of travel time profiles.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496661625", "name": "g veit batz"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81461657429", "name": "robert geisberger"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100534206", "name": "peter sanders"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384615359", "name": "christian vetter"}], "citations": ["Julian Dibbelt , Ben Strasser , Dorothea Wagner, Customizable Contraction Hierarchies, Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms, June 29-July 01, 2014\n", "Moritz Baum , Julian Dibbelt , Thomas Pajor , Dorothea Wagner, Energy-optimal routes for electric vehicles, Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, November 05-08, 2013, Orlando, Florida\n", "Chun Jiang Zhu , Kam-Yiu Lam , Reynold C.K.

Since many contemporary networks are not static but evolve over time, traditional static approaches can be inappropriate for specific tasks. In this work, we pioneer the NP-hard problem of online dynamic modularity maximization. We develop scalable dynamizations of the currently fastest and the most widespread static heuristics and engineer a heuristic dynamization of an optimal static algorithm. Our algorithms efficiently maintain amodularity-based clustering of a graph for which dynamic changes arrive as a stream. For our quickest heuristic we prove a tight bound on its number of operations. In an experimental evaluation on both a real-world dynamic network and on dynamic clustered random graphs, we show that the dynamic maintenance of a clustering of a changing graph yields highermodularitythan recomputation, guarantees much smoother clustering dynamics, and requires much lower runtimes. We conclude with giving sound recommendations for the choice of an algorithm.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384592403", "name": "robert gorke"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496652810", "name": "pascal maillard"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488671692", "name": "andrea schumm"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81496652588", "name": "christian staudt"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100168505", "name": "dorothea wagner"}], "citations": ["O.V.

In this framework, we focus on the implementation of dictionaries and perform a thorough experimental study using a testbed that we designed for this purpose. Our main discovery is that the best-known (asymptotically optimal) resilient data structures have very large space overheads. More precisely, most of the space used by these data structures is not due to key storage. This might not be acceptable in practice, since resilient data structures are meant for applications where a huge amount of data (often of the order of terabytes) has to be stored. Exploiting techniques developed in the context of resilient (static) sorting and searching, in combination with some new ideas, we designed and engineered an alternative implementation, which, while still guaranteeing optimal asymptotic time and space bounds, performs much better in terms of memory without compromising the time efficiency.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418593327", "name": "umberto ferraro-petrillo"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100323131", "name": "fabrizio grandoni"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100203365", "name": "giuseppe f italiano"}], "citations": ["Lorenzo De Stefani , Francesco Silvestri, Exploiting non-constant safe memory in resilient algorithms and data structures, Theoretical Computer Science, v.583 n.C, p.86-97, June 2015\n"]}, "Article No.: 2.6": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "39\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "133\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2532568", "references": ["Abadie, J. and Carpentier, J. 1969.

Our algorithmic improvements include (i) the use of a fast (but not 100&percnt; accurate) canonical labeling algorithm, (ii) name reuse (i.e., storing intermediate results rather than recomputing), and (iii) an incremental approach to canonical name computation. The time to map the reactions from the Kegg/Ligand database previously took over 2 days using CCV, but now it takes fewer than 4 hours to complete.

The problem captures the challenging task of increasing the spatial resolution of experimental data in order to get a better picture of the protein structure. Since solutions proposed by any algorithmic framework have to ultimately be verified by biochemists, it is important to provide not just a single solution, but a valuable set of candidate solutions. Our contribution is a polynomial-delay, polynomial-space algorithm for enumerating all exact solutions plus further approximate solutions, which are guaranteed to be within an absolute error of two of the optimum within fragments of the protein, that is, within sets of consecutive residues. Our experiments indicate that the quality of the approximate solutions is comparable to the optimal ones in terms of deviation from the underlying true solution. In addition, the experiments also confirm the effectiveness of the method in reducing the delay between two consecutive solutions considerably, compared to what it takes an integer programming solver to produce the next exact solution.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81421601779", "name": "stefan canzar"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323489922", "name": "khaled elbassioni"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81318490291", "name": "julian mestre"}], "citations": ["Jaroslaw Byrka , Andreas Karrenbauer , Laura Sanit\u00e0, The interval constrained 3-coloring problem, Theoretical Computer Science, v.593 n.C, p.42-50, August 2015\n"]}, "Article No.: 2.1": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "3\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "47\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "4\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "279\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2444016.2461327", "references": ["Mohamed I.

In large-scale applications, compressed suffix trees (CSTs) are therefore used instead. A CST consists of three (compressed) components: the suffix array, the longest common prefix (LCP)-array and data structures for simulating navigational operations on the suffix tree. The LCP-array stores the lengths of the LCPs of lexicographically adjacent suffixes, and it can be computed in linear time. In this article, we present a new LCP-array construction algorithm that is fast and very space efficient. In practice, our algorithm outperforms alternative algorithms. Moreover, we introduce a new compressed representation of LCP-arrays.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81351592081", "name": "simon gog"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100396088", "name": "enno ohlebusch"}], "citations": ["Enno Ohlebusch , Timo Beller , Mohamed I.

Such an extension has been in operation in the National Resident Matching Problem (NRMP) matching scheme in the United States for a number of years. In this setting, a stable matching need not exist, and it is an NP-complete problem to decide if one does. However, the only previous empirical study in this context (focused on the NRMP algorithm), together with information from NRMP, suggest that, in practice, stable matchings do exist and that an appropriate heuristic can be used to find such a matching.The study presented here was motivated by the recent decision to accommodate couples in the Scottish Foundation Allocation Scheme (SFAS), the Scottish equivalent of the NRMP. Here, the problem is a special case, since hospital preferences are derived from a \u201cmaster list\u201d of resident scores, but we show that the existence problem remains NP-complete in this case. We describe the algorithm used in SFAS and contrast it with a version of the algorithm that forms the basis of the NRMP approach. We also propose a third simpler algorithm based on satisfying blocking pairs, and an FPT algorithm when the number of couples is viewed as a parameter. We present an empirical study of the performance of a number of variants of these algorithms using a range of datasets. The results indicate that, not surprisingly, increasing the ratio of couples to single applicants typically makes it harder to find a stable matching (and, by inference, less likely that a stable matching exists). However, the likelihood of finding a stable matching is very high for realistic values of this ratio, and especially so for particular variants of the algorithms.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81324488134", "name": "peter biro"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100567991", "name": "robert w irving"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413605294", "name": "ildiko schlotter"}], "citations": ["Stability in Large Matching Markets with Complementarities, Operations Research, v.62 n.4, p.713-732, August 2014\n", "Itai Ashlagi , Mark Braverman , Avinatan Hassidim, Stability in Large Matching Markets with Complementarities, Operations Research, v.62 n.4, p.713-732, August 2014\n", "Itai Ashlagi , Mark Braverman , Avinatan Hassidim, Stability in Large Matching Markets with Complementarities, Operations Research, v.62 n.4, p.713-732, August 2014\n", "P\u00e9ter Bir\u00f3 , David F.

An analysis of the mean trace length ofnrandom motorcycles suggests that, on average, a motorcycle crosses only a constant number of cells within a &sqrt;n\u00d7 &sqrt;nrectangular grid, provided that the motorcycles are distributed sufficiently uniformly over the area covered by the grid. This analysis motivates a simple algorithm for computing motorcycle graphs: We use the standard priority-queue--based algorithm and enhance it with geometric hashing by means of a rectangular grid. If the motorcycles are distributed sufficiently uniformly, then our stochastic analysis predicts anO(nlogn) runtime. Indeed, extensive experiments run on 22,000 synthetic and real-world datasets confirm a runtime of less than 10\u22125nlognseconds for the vast majority of our datasets on a standard PC. Further experiments with our software, Moca, also confirm the mean trace length and average number of cells crossed by a motorcycle, as predicted by our analysis. This makes Moca the first implementation that is efficient enough to be applied in practice for computing motorcycle graphs of large datasets. Actually, it is easy to extend Moca to make it compute a generalized version of the original motorcycle graph, thus enabling a significantly larger field of applications.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81430639835", "name": "stefan huber"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100493664", "name": "martin held"}], "citations": ["Antoine Vigneron , Lie Yan, A Faster Algorithm for Computing Motorcycle Graphs, Discrete & Computational Geometry, v.52 n.3, p.492-514, October   2014\n"]}, "Article No.: 1.4": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "22\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "8\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "229\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1963190.2019579", "references": ["David J.

Computing out-of-core permits to solve larger problems than otherwise possible on the same hardware setup. Also, when using shared computing resources with high demand, a problem can take longer to compute in terms of wall-clock time when using an in-core algorithm on many nodes instead of using an out-of-core algorithm on few nodes. The difference is due to wait-in-queue delays that can grow exponentially to the number of requested nodes. In one specific case, using our best method and only 16 nodes it can take several times less wall-clock time to generate a 2 billion element mesh than to generate the same size mesh in-core with 121 nodes.Although our best out-of-core method exhibits unavoidable overheads (could be as low as 19&percnt; in some cases) over the corresponding in-core method (for mesh sizes that fit completely in-core), this is a modest and expected performance penalty.

Consequently, LDS repeatedly probes the state space, going against the heuristic (i.e., taking discrepancies) a specified number of times in all possible ways and attempts to take those discrepancies as early as possible. LDS was improved by Richard Korf, to become improved LDS (ILDS), but in doing so, discrepancies were taken as late as possible, going against the original assumption. Many subsequent algorithms have faithfully inherited Korf's interpretation of LDS, and take discrepancies late.

Therefore, we propose to get around this issue by generalizing this classical approach through the use of higher-order edge switches.

Denoising array-based Comparative Genome Hybridization (aCGH) data is an important computational problem central to understanding cancer evolution. In this article, we propose a new formulation of the denoising problem that we solve with a \u201cvanilla\u201d dynamic programming algorithm, which runs inO(n2) units of time. Then, we propose two approximation techniques. Our first algorithm reduces the problem into a well-studied geometric problem, namely halfspace emptiness queries, and provides an &epsi; additive approximation to the optimal objective value in \u00d5(n&frac43;+\u03b4log (&fracU;&epsi;)) time, where \u03b4 is an arbitrarily small positive constant andU= max&lcub;&sqrtC;,(|Pi|)i=1,\u2026,n&rcub; (P=(P1,P2, \u2026,Pn),Pi\u2208 \u211d, is the vector of the noisy aCGH measurements,Ca normalization constant). The second algorithm provides a (1 \u00b1 &epsi;) approximation (multiplicative error) and runs inO(nlogn/&epsi;) time. The algorithm decomposes the initial problem into a small (logarithmic) number of Monge optimization subproblems that we can solve in linear time using existing techniques.Finally, we validate our model on synthetic and real cancer datasets. Our method consistently achieves superior precision and recall to leading competitors on the data with ground truth. In addition, it finds several novel markers not recorded in the benchmarks but supported in the oncology literature.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384619692", "name": "charalampos e tsourakakis"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81474687261", "name": "richard peng"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81493658044", "name": "maria a tsiarli"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100160771", "name": "gary l miller"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100403405", "name": "russell schwartz"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 2.4": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "240\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1963190.1970377", "references": ["Aggarwal, A., Alpern, B., Chandra, A., and Snir, M. 1987.

Its exact maximization is NP-hard and prohibitively expensive for large graphs. Popular heuristics first perform a coarsening phase, where local search starting from singleton clusters is used to compute a preliminary clustering, and then optionally a refinement phase, where this clustering is improved by moving vertices between clusters. As a generalization, multilevel heuristics coarsen in several stages, and refine by moving entire clusters from each of these stages, not only individual vertices.This article organizes existing and new single-level and multilevel heuristics into a coherent design space, and compares them experimentally with respect to their effectiveness (achieved modularity) and runtime. For coarsening by iterated cluster joining, it turns out that the most widely used criterion for joining clusters (modularity increase) is outperformed by other simple criteria, that a recent multistep algorithm [Schuetz and Caflisch 2008] is no improvement over simple single-step coarsening for these criteria, and that the recent multilevel coarsening by iterated vertex moving [Blondel et al. 2008] is somewhat faster but slightly less effective (with refinement). The new multilevel refinement is significantly more effective than the conventional single-level refinement or no refinement, in reasonable runtime.A comparison with published benchmark results and algorithm implementations shows that multilevel local search heuristics, despite their relative simplicity, are competitive with the best algorithms in the literature.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81436602715", "name": "randolf rotta"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100631724", "name": "andreas noack"}], "citations": ["Riza Aktunc , Ismail Hakki Toroslu , Mert Ozer , Hasan Davulcu, A Dynamic Modularity Based Community Detection Algorithm for Large-scale Networks: DSLM, Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining 2015, August 25-28, 2015, Paris, France\n", "Christian Staudt , Andrea Schumm , Henning Meyerhenke , Robert Gorke , Dorothea Wagner, Static and Dynamic Aspects of Scientific Collaboration Networks, Proceedings of the 2012 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2012), p.522-526, August 26-29, 2012\n", "Yazan Boshmaf , Konstantin Beznosov , Matei Ripeanu, Graph-based Sybil detection in social and information systems, Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, August 25-28, 2013, Niagara, Ontario, Canada\n", "Robert G\u00f6rke , Andrea Schumm , Dorothea Wagner, Experiments on density-constrained graph clustering, Proceedings of the Meeting on Algorithm Engineering & Expermiments, p.1-15, January 16-16, 2012, Kyoto, Japan\n", "Ludo Waltman , Nees Jan van Eck, A new methodology for constructing a publication-level classification system of science, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, v.63 n.12, p.2378-2392, December 2012\n", "Ying Kang , Xiaoyan Gu , Weiping Wang , Dan Meng, Scalable Clustering Algorithm via a Triangle Folding Processing for Complex Networks, Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, October 18-23, 2015, Melbourne, Australia\n", "Alan Valejo , Jorge Valverde-Rebaza , Brett Drury , Alneu de Andrade Lopes, Multilevel refinement based on neighborhood similarity, Proceedings of the 18th International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium, p.67-76, July 07-09, 2014, Porto, Portugal\n", "Alina Campan , Yasmeen Alufaisan , Traian Marius Truta, Preserving Communities in Anonymized Social Networks, Transactions on Data Privacy, v.8 n.1, p.55-87, April 2015\n"]}, "Article No.: 2.2": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "10\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "103\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1963190.1970375", "references": ["Pankaj K.

Recently, it was observed (Belazzougui et al. 2009) that very frequently the keys to be hashed are sorted in their intrinsic (i.e., lexicographical) order. This is typically the case of dictionaries of search engines, list of URLs of Web graphs, and so on. We refer to this restricted version of the problem asmonotone minimal perfect hashing.

In the classical model, in each round, each informed node informs a random neighbor. In the recently proposed quasirandom variant, each node has a (cyclic) list of its neighbors. Once informed, it starts at a random position of the list, but from then on informs its neighbors in the order of the list.While for sparse random graphs a better performance of the quasirandom model could be proven, all other results show that, independent of the structure of the lists, the same asymptotic performance guarantees hold as for the classical model.In this work, we compare the two models experimentally. Not only does this show that the quasirandom model generally is faster, but it also shows that the runtime is more concentrated around the mean. This is surprising given that much fewer random bits are used in the quasirandom process.These advantages are also observed in a lossy communication model, where each transmission does not reach its target with a certain probability, and in an asynchronous model, where nodes send at random times drawn from an exponential distribution. We also show that typically the particular structure of the lists has little influence on the efficiency.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100319335", "name": "benjamin doerr"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81333488537", "name": "tobias friedrich"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81490686688", "name": "marvin kunnemann"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323495935", "name": "thomas sauerwald"}], "citations": ["Benjamin Doerr , Anna Huber , Ariel Levavi, Strong robustness of randomized rumor spreading protocols, Discrete Applied Mathematics, v.161 n.6, p.778-793, April, 2013\n", "Benjamin Doerr , Tobias Friedrich , Thomas Sauerwald, Quasirandom Rumor Spreading, ACM Transactions on Algorithms (TALG), v.11 n.2, p.1-35, November 2014\n"]}, "Article No.: 3.1": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "9\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "65\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1963190.2025377", "references": [], "title": "Guest editors' foreword", "affiliation_data": [{"affiliation": "sapienza university of rome", "name": "irene finocchi"}, {"affiliation": "mentor graphics corp program co-chairs 11th workshop on algorithm engineering and experiments", "name": "john hershberger"}], "abstract": "An abstract is not available.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100246662", "name": "irene finocchi"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100630389", "name": "john hershberger"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 3.6": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "21\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "166\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1963190.2025382", "references": ["Jochen Alber , Frederic Dorn , Rolf Niedermeier, Experimental evaluation of a tree decomposition-based algorithm for vertex cover on planar graphs, Discrete Applied Mathematics, v.145 n.2, p.219-231, 15 January 2005[doi>10.1016/j.dam.2004.01.013]\n", "Sanjeev Arora, Polynomial time approximation schemes for Euclidean traveling salesman and other geometric problems, Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.45 n.5, p.753-782, Sept. 1998[doi>10.1145/290179.290180]\n", "Arora, S. 2003.

Whereas this result, and several other PTAS results of the recent years, are of high theoretical importance, no practical applications or even implementation attempts have been known to date, due to the extremely large constants that are involved in them. We describe techniques on how to circumvent the challenges in implementing such a scheme. With today's limitations on processing power and space, we still have to sacrifice approximation guarantees for improved running times by choosing some parameters empirically. But our experiments show that with our choice of parameters, we do get the desired approximation ratios, suggesting that a much tighter analysis might be possible.Our computational experiments with benchmark instances from SteinLib and large artificial instances well exceeded our own expectations. We demonstrate that we are able to handle instances with up to a million nodes and several hundreds of terminals in 1.5 hours on a standard PC. On the rectilinear preprocessed instances from SteinLib, we observe a monotonous improvement for smaller values of &epsi;, with an average gap below 1&percnt; for &epsi; &equals; 0.1. We compare our implementation against the well-known batched 1-Steiner heuristic and observe that on very large instances, we are able to produce comparable solutions much faster. We also present a thorough experimental evaluation of the influence of the various parameters of the PTAS and thus obtain a better understanding of their empirical effects.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81416602817", "name": "siamak tazari"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100571254", "name": "matthias muller-hannemann"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 3.4": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "22\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "175\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1963190.2025380", "references": ["Alber, J. and Niedermeier, R. 2000.

One of the most successful methods of arranging the objects in the index structure is based on sorting the objects according to the positions of their centers along a two-dimensional Hilbert space-filling curve. Alternatively, one may use the coordinates of the objects' bounding boxes to represent each object by a four-dimensional point, and sort these points along a four-dimensional Hilbert-type curve. In experiments by Kamel and Faloutsos and by Arge et al., the first solution consistently outperformed the latter when applied to point data, while the latter solution clearly outperformed the first on certain artificial rectangle data. These authors did not specify which four-dimensional Hilbert-type curve was used; many exist.In this article, we show that the results of the previous articles can be explained by the choice of the four-dimensional Hilbert-type curve that was used and by the way it was rotated in four-dimensional space. By selecting a curve that has certain properties and choosing the right rotation, one can combine the strengths of the two-dimensional and the four-dimensional approach into one, while avoiding their apparent weaknesses. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with experiments on various datasets. For real data taken from VLSI design, our new curve yields R-trees with query times that are better than those of R-trees that were obtained with previously used curves.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100467783", "name": "herman haverkort"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384613967", "name": "freek v walderveen"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 3.5": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "1\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "39\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "273\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1963190.2025381", "references": ["Ravindra K.

Therefore, computing the pathwidth and associated path decomposition of graphs has both a theoretical and practical interest. In this article, we design a branch-and-bound algorithm that computes the exact pathwidth of graphs and a corresponding path decomposition. Our main contribution consists of several nontrivial techniques to reduce the size of the input graph (preprocessing) and to cut the exploration space during the search phase of the algorithm. We evaluate experimentally our algorithm by comparing it to existing algorithms of the literature. It appears from the simulations that our algorithm offers a significant gain with respect to previous work. In particular, it is able to compute the exact pathwidth of any graph with less than 60 nodes in a reasonable running time (&les; 10min on a standard laptop). Moreover, our algorithm achieves good performance when used as a heuristic (i.e., when returning best result found within bounded time limit). Our algorithm is not restricted to undirected graphs since it actually computes the directed pathwidth that generalizes the notion of pathwidth to digraphs.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100038338", "name": "david coudert"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81418592697", "name": "dorian mazauric"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81430617307", "name": "nicolas nisse"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 1.4": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "11\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "11\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "11\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2851493", "references": ["Pankaj K.

We are given a set of feature points in the plane labeled by a set of mutually disjoint labels, where each label is an axis-aligned rectangle attached with one corner to its respective point. We require that each label remains horizontally aligned during the map rotation, and our goal is to find a set of mutually nonoverlappingvisiblelabels for every rotation angle \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) so that the number of visible labels over a full map rotation of 2\u03c0 is maximized.We discuss and experimentally evaluate several labeling strategies that define additional consistency constraints on label visibility to reduce flickering effects during monotone map rotation. We introduce three heuristic algorithms and compare them experimentally to an existing approximation algorithm and exact solutions obtained from an integer linear program.

Often, this is achieved in two phases: (1) derive auxiliary data in an expensive preprocessing phase, and (2) use this auxiliary data to speed up the query phase. By adding a fast weight-customization phase, we extend Contraction Hierarchies to support a three-phase workflow. The expensive preprocessing is split into a phase exploiting solely the unweighted topology of the graph and a lightweight phase that adapts the auxiliary data to a specific weight. We achieve this by basing our Customizable Contraction Hierarchies (CCHs) on nested dissection orders. We provide an in-depth experimental analysis on large road and game maps showing that CCHs are a very practicable solution in scenarios where edge weights often change.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=86158727557", "name": "julian dibbelt"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81487655629", "name": "ben strasser"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100168505", "name": "dorothea wagner"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 1.6": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "55\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "16\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "55\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2851496", "references": ["D.

Identifying extremal sets is a fundamental problem with a wide range of applications in SAT solvers, data mining, and social network analysis. In this article, we present two novel improvements of the high-quality extremal set identification algorithm,AMS-Lex, described by Bayardo and Panda. The first technique uses memoization to improve the execution time of the single-threaded variant of the AMS-Lex, while our second improvement uses parallel programming methods. In a subset of the presented experiments, our memoized algorithm executes more than 400 times faster than the highly efficient publicly available implementation of AMS-Lex. Moreover, we show that our modified algorithm's speedup is not bounded above by a constant and that it increases as the length of the common prefixes in successive inputitemsetsincreases. We provide experimental results using both real-world and synthetic datasets, and show our multithreaded variant algorithm outperforming AMS-Lex by 3 to 6 times. We find that on synthetic input datasets, when executed using 16 CPU cores of a 32-core machine, our multithreaded program executes about as fast as the state-of-the-art parallel GPU-based program using an NVIDIA GTX 580 graphics processing unit.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658995687", "name": "martin marinov"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388600663", "name": "nicholas nash"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100422211", "name": "david gregg"}], "citations": []}}}}, "Volume17,": {"Issue1": {"date": {"year": "2012", "month": 0}, "articles": {"Article No.: 1.1": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "35\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "656\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2133803.2133804", "references": ["Aho, A. and Ullman, J. 1992.

We define theanatree, a data structure that can solve many such problems in constant time with respect to the size of the lexicon. The structure represents the lexicon of a language in a format somewhat analogous to a binary decision diagram (BDD) and, as with BDDs, construction heuristics allow the real average-case performance to vastly exceed the theoretical worst case.

Using techniques of second-order cone programming and \"core-sets\", we have developed (1 + \u03b5)-approximation algorithms that perform well in practice, especially for very high dimensions, in addition to having provable guarantees. We prove the existence of core-sets of sizeO(1/\u03b5), improving the previous bound ofO(1/\u03b52), and we study empirically how the core-set size grows with dimension. We show that our algorithm, which is simple to implement, results in fast computation of nearly optimal solutions for point sets in much higher dimension than previously computable using exact techniques.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100380788", "name": "piyush kumar"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81452606041", "name": "joseph s b mitchell"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100650621", "name": "e alper yildirim"}], "citations": ["Shaoning Pang , Fan Liu , Youki Kadobayashi , Tao Ban , Daisuke Inoue, Training minimum enclosing balls for cross tasks knowledge transfer, Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Neural Information Processing, November 12-15, 2012, Doha, Qatar\n", "S.

In our original burstsort, string keys sharing a common prefix were managed via a bucket of pointers represented as a list or array; this approach was found to be up to twice as fast as the previous best string sorts, mostly because of a sharp reduction in out-of-cache references. In this paper, we introduce C-burstsort, which copies the unexamined tail of each key to the bucket and discards the original key to improve data locality. On both Intel and PowerPC architectures, and on a wide range of string types, we show that sorting is typically twice as fast as our original burstsort and four to five times faster than multikey quicksort and previous radixsorts. A variant that copies both suffixes and record pointers to buckets, CP-burstsort, uses more memory, but provides stable sorting. In current computers, where performance is limited by memory access latencies, these new algorithms can dramatically reduce the time needed for internal sorting of large numbers of strings.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332527852", "name": "ranjan sinha"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100029320", "name": "justin zobel"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323495052", "name": "david ring"}], "citations": ["Juha K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen , Tommi Rantala, Engineering Radix Sort for Strings, Proceedings of the 15th International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval, p.3-14, November 10-12, 2008, Melbourne, Australia\n", "Nicholas Nash , David Gregg, Comparing integer data structures for 32 and 64 bit keys, Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Experimental algorithms, p.28-42, May 30-June 01, 2008, Provincetown, MA, USA\n", "Carsten Binnig , Stefan Hildenbrand , Franz F\u00e4rber, Dictionary-based order-preserving string compression for main memory column stores, Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data, June 29-July 02, 2009, Providence, Rhode Island, USA\n", "Ranjan Sinha , Anthony Wirth, Engineering burstsort: towards fast in-place string sorting, Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Experimental algorithms, p.14-27, May 30-June 01, 2008, Provincetown, MA, USA\n", "Carmel Kent , Moshe Lewenstein , Dafna Sheinwald, On demand string sorting over unbounded alphabets, Proceedings of the 18th annual conference on Combinatorial Pattern Matching, July 09-11, 2007, London, Canada\n", "Carmel Kent , Moshe Lewenstein , Dafna Sheinwald, On demand string sorting over unbounded alphabets, Theoretical Computer Science, 426-427, p.66-74, April, 2012\n", "Frank Drews , Jens Lichtenberg , Lonnie Welch, Scalable parallel word search in multicore/multiprocessor systems, The Journal of Supercomputing, v.51 n.1, p.58-75, January   2010\n", "Ranjan Sinha , Anthony Wirth, Engineering burstsort: Toward fast in-place string sorting, Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), 15, 2010\n", "Nicholas Nash , David Gregg, Comparing integer data structures for 32- and 64-bit keys, Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), 15, 2010\n", "Vladimir Estivill-Castro, Sorting and order statistics, Algorithms and theory of computation handbook: general concepts and techniques, Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2010\n", "Nikolas Askitis , Ranjan Sinha, HAT-trie: a cache-conscious trie-based data structure for strings, Proceedings of the thirtieth Australasian conference on Computer science, p.97-105, January 30-February 02, 2007, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia\n", "Nikolas Askitis , Ranjan Sinha, Engineering scalable, cache and space efficient tries for strings, The VLDB Journal \u2014 The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases, v.19 n.5, p.633-660, October   2010\n", "Nikolas Askitis , Justin Zobel, Redesigning the string hash table, burst trie, and BST to exploit cache, Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), 15, 2010\n"]}, "Article No.: 1.3": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "3\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "13\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "640\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1187436.1210586", "references": ["ADVISOR Project. http://advisor.usc.edu/.\n", "Doug Burger , Todd M.

Compiler optimizations exist and optimizations have been done for many problems. Much of this work has focused on dense linear algebra problems. At first glance, the Floyd--Warshall algorithm appears to fall into this category. In this paper, we begin by applying two standard cache-friendly optimizations to the Floyd--Warshall algorithm and show limited performance improvements. We then discuss the unidirectional space time representation (USTR). We show analytically that the USTR can be used to reduce the amount of processor-memory traffic by a factor of O(&sqrt;C), where C is the cache size, for a large class of algorithms. Since the USTR leads to a tiled implementation, we develop a tile size selection heuristic to intelligently narrow the search space for the tile size that minimizes total execution time. Using the USTR, we develop a cache-friendly implementation of the Floyd--Warshall algorithm. We show experimentally that this implementation minimizes the level-1 and level-2 cache misses and TLB misses and, therefore, exhibits the best overall performance. Using this implementation, we show a 2x improvement in performance over the best compiler optimized implementation on three different architectures. Finally, we show analytically that our implementation of the Floyd--Warshall algorithm is asymptotically optimal with respect to processor-memory traffic. We show experimental results for the Pentium III, Alpha, and MIPS R12000 machines using problem sizes between 1024 and 2048 vertices. We demonstrate improved cache performance using the Simplescalar simulator.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81323494604", "name": "michael penner"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81333490455", "name": "viktor k prasanna"}], "citations": ["Tomonori Mori , Takuya Asaka , Tatsuro Takahashi, A novel cooperative caching scheme for unstrutured peer-to-peer networks, Proceedings of the 6th IEEE Conference on Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, p.765-769, January 11-13, 2009, Las Vegas, NV, USA\n", "Xiaoxin Tang , Long Zheng , Jun Ma , Yao Shen , Li Li , Minyi Guo, PMA: Pixel-based multi-anchor algorithm for image recognition on multi-core systems, Proceedings of the 2012 International Workshop on Programming Models and Applications for Multicores and Manycores, p.36-44, February 26-26, 2012, New Orleans, Louisiana\n", "Gary J.

Secure group communication systems typically rely on a group key, which is a secret shared among the members of the group. This key is used to provide privacy by encrypting all group communications. Because groups can be large and highly dynamic, it becomes necessary to change the group key in a scalable and secure fashion when members join and leave the group. We present a series of algorithms for solving this problem based on key trees. The algorithms attempt to minimize the worst-case communication cost of updates by maintaining balanced key tree structures. We focus on the trade-off between the communication cost because of the structure of the tree and that due to the overhead of restructuring the tree to maintain its balanced structure.

This paper describes new algorithms for computing separators in planar graphs as well as techniques that can be used to speed up the implementation of graph partitioning algorithms and improve the partition quality. In particular, we consider planar graphs with costs and weights on the vertices, where weights are used to estimate the sizes of the partitions and costs are used to estimate the size of the separator. We show that in these graphs one can always find a small cost separator (consisting of vertices or edges) that partitions the graph into components of bounded weight.

A key design problem here is the choice of a suitable direction in which the digital model should be oriented and built so as to minimize the area of contact between the prototype and temporary support structures that are generated during the build. Devising an efficient algorithm for computing such a direction has remained a difficult problem for quite some time. In this paper, a suite of efficient and practical heuristics is presented for estimating the minimum contact area. Also given is a technique for evaluating the quality of the estimate provided by any heuristic, which does not require knowledge of the (unknown and hard-to-compute) optimal solution; instead, it provides an indirect upper bound on the quality of the estimate via two relatively easy-to-compute quantities. The algorithms are based on various techniques from computational geometry, such as ray-shooting, convex hulls, boolean operations on polygons, and spherical arrangements, and have been implemented and tested. Experimental results on a wide range of real-world models show that the heuristics perform quite well in practice.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100627093", "name": "ivayio ilinkin"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100533794", "name": "ravi janardan"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100456878", "name": "michiel smid"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81330492365", "name": "eric johnson"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100469794", "name": "paul castillo"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100306655", "name": "jorg schwerdt"}], "citations": []}}}}, "Volume9,": {"Issue1": {"date": {"year": "2004", "month": 0}, "articles": {"Article No.: 1.1": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "1\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "13\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "2769\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1005813.1005815", "references": ["Ahuja, R., Magnanti, T., and Orlin, J. 1993.

Refinement-based pathfinding algorithms, such as Classic Refinement (CR), find quality paths in very large sparse graphs where traditional search techniques fail to generate paths in acceptable time. In this paper, we present a performance evaluation study of three simple data structure transformations aimed at improving the data reference locality of CR. These transformations are robust to changes in computer architecture and the degree of compiler optimization.

It is based on reading backwards enough l-grams from text windows so as to prove that no occurrence can contain the part of the window read, and then shifting the window.We show analytically that our algorithm is optimal on average. Hence our first contribution is to fill an important gap in the area, since no average-optimal algorithm existed for multiple approximate string matching.We consider several variants and practical improvements to our algorithm, and show experimentally that they are resistant to the number of patterns and the fastest for low difference ratios, displacing the long-standing best algorithms. Hence our second contribution is to give a practical algorithm for this problem, by far better than any existing alternative in many cases of interest. On real-life texts, our algorithm is especially interesting for computational biology applications.In particular, we show that our algorithm can be successfully used to search for one pattern, where many more competing algorithms exist. Our algorithm is also average-optimal in this case, being the second after that of Chang and Marr. However, our algorithm permits higher difference ratios than Chang and Marr, and this is our third contribution.In practice, our algorithm is competitive in this scenario too, being the fastest for low difference ratios and moderate alphabet sizes.

The size of main memory in typical computers continues to grow but memory accesses require increasing numbers of instruction cycles, which is a problem for the most efficient of the existing string-sorting algorithms as they do not utilize cache well for large data sets. We propose a new sorting algorithm for strings, burstsort, based on dynamic construction of a compact trie in which strings are kept in buckets. It is simple, fast, and efficient. We experimentally explore key implementation options and compare burstsort to existing string-sorting algorithms on large and small sets of strings with a range of characteristics. These experiments show that, for large sets of strings, burstsort is almost twice as fast as any previous algorithm, primarily due to a lower rate of cache miss.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332527852", "name": "ranjan sinha"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100029320", "name": "justin zobel"}], "citations": ["Juha K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen , Tommi Rantala, Engineering Radix Sort for Strings, Proceedings of the 15th International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval, p.3-14, November 10-12, 2008, Melbourne, Australia\n", "Leonor Frias , Jordi Petit, Combining digital access and parallel partition for quicksort and quickselect, Proceedings of the 2009 ICSE Workshop on Multicore Software Engineering, p.33-40, May 18-18, 2009\n", "Ranjan Sinha , Justin Zobel, Efficient trie-based sorting of large sets of strings, Proceedings of the 26th Australasian computer science conference, p.11-18, February 01, 2003, Adelaide, Australia\n", "Nicholas Nash , David Gregg, Comparing integer data structures for 32 and 64 bit keys, Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Experimental algorithms, p.28-42, May 30-June 01, 2008, Provincetown, MA, USA\n", "Ranjan Sinha , Justin Zobel, Using random sampling to build approximate tries for efficient string sorting, Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), 10, 2005\n", "Hiroshi Inoue , Kenjiro Taura, SIMD- and cache-friendly algorithm for sorting an array of structures, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, v.8 n.11, p.1274-1285, July 2015\n", "Ranjan Sinha , Justin Zobel , David Ring, Cache-efficient string sorting using copying, Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), 11, 2006\n", "Ranjan Sinha , Anthony Wirth, Engineering burstsort: towards fast in-place string sorting, Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Experimental algorithms, p.14-27, May 30-June 01, 2008, Provincetown, MA, USA\n", "Nikolas Askitis , Justin Zobel, Cache-Conscious collision resolution in string hash tables, Proceedings of the 12th international conference on String Processing and Information Retrieval, November 02-04, 2005, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n", "Dawei Jiang , Gang Chen , Beng Chin Ooi , Kian-Lee Tan , Sai Wu, epiC: an extensible and scalable system for processing big data, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, v.7 n.7, p.541-552, March 2014\n", "Frank Drews , Jens Lichtenberg , Lonnie Welch, Scalable parallel word search in multicore/multiprocessor systems, The Journal of Supercomputing, v.51 n.1, p.58-75, January   2010\n", "Dawei Jiang , Sai Wu , Gang Chen , Beng Chin Ooi , Kian-Lee Tan , Jun Xu, epiC: an extensible and scalable system for processing Big Data, The VLDB Journal \u2014 The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases, v.25 n.1, p.3-26, February  2016\n", "Vladimir Estivill-Castro, Sorting and order statistics, Algorithms and theory of computation handbook: general concepts and techniques, Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2010\n", "Ranjan Sinha , Anthony Wirth, Engineering burstsort: Toward fast in-place string sorting, Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), 15, 2010\n", "Michael A.

This paper describes and exemplifies the ease of obtaining high performance priority queues using a two-tier list-based structure. This new implementation, called theTwolstructure, is amalgamated with three priority queues, namely, the Henriksen's queue, splay tree and skew heap, to enhance the efficiency of thesebasalpriority queue structures. Using a model that combines traditional average case and amortized complexity analysis, Twol-amalgamated priority queues that maintainNactive events are theoretically proven to offer O(1)expected amortized complexityunder reasonable assumptions. They are also demonstrated empirically to offer stable near O(1) performance for widely varying priority increment distributions and for queue sizes ranging from 10 to 10 million. Extensive empirical results show that the Twol-amalgamated priority queues consistently outperform those basal structures (i.e., without the Twol structure) with an average speedup of about three to five times on widely different hardware architectures. These results provide testimony that the Twol-amalgamated priority queues are suitable for implementation in sizeable application scenarios such as, but not limited to, large-scale discrete event simulation.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81453616069", "name": "rick siow mong goh"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100332451", "name": "ian li-jin thng"}], "citations": ["Yi Sun , Xiaolin Hu, Performance Measurement of Dynamic Structure DEVS for Large-Scale Cellular Space Models, Simulation, v.85 n.5, p.335-351, May       2009\n"]}}}}, "Volume2,": {"Issue1": {"date": {"year": "1997", "month": 0}, "articles": {"Article No.: 5": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "12\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "40\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "389\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/264216.264223", "references": ["Alfred V.

We\r\nimplement two compression algorithms which use (1)FPwith\r\nLZW dictionary (LZW-FP), and (2)FPwith an\r\nalternative flexible dictionary (FPA as introduced in [Hor95]). Our\r\nimplementations are based on novel on-line data structures enabling\r\nus to use linear time and space. We test our implementations on a\r\ncollection of input sequences which includes textual files, DNA\r\nsequences, medical images, and pseudorandom binary files, and\r\ncompare our results with two of the most popular compression\r\nprogramsUNIX compressandgzip. Our results\r\ndemonstrate that flexible parsing is especially useful for\r\nnon-textual data, on which it improves over the compression rates\r\nofcompressandgzipby up to 20% and 35%,\r\nrespectively.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100094018", "name": "yossi matias"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100504095", "name": "nasir rajpoot"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81309511532", "name": "cenk sahinalp"}], "citations": ["Maxime Crochemore , Laura Giambruno , Alessio Langiu , Filippo Mignosi , Antonio Restivo, Dictionary-symbolwise flexible parsing, Proceedings of the 21st international conference on Combinatorial algorithms, p.390-403, July 26-28, 2010, London, UK\n", "Maxime Crochemore , Laura Giambruno , Alessio Langiu , Filippo Mignosi , Antonio Restivo, Dictionary-symbolwise flexible parsing, Journal of Discrete Algorithms, 14, p.74-90, July, 2012\n"]}, "Article No.: 7": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "10\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "38\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "882\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/945394.945401", "references": ["Alok Aggarwal , Jeffrey,S.

However, the use of these massive datasets also exposes scalability problems with existing GIS algorithms. These scalability problems are mainly due to the fact that most GIS algorithms have been designed to minimize internal computation time, while I/O communication often is the bottleneck when processing massive amounts of data. In this paper, we consider I/O-efficient algorithms for problems on grid-based terrains.Detailed grid-based terrain data is rapidly becoming available for much of the earth's surface. We describe [EQUATION] I/O algorithms for several problems on [EQUATION] grids for which only O(N) algorithms were previously known. HereMdenotes the size of the main memory andBthe size of a disk block.We demonstrate the practical merits of our work by comparing the empirical performance of our new algorithm for theflow accumulationproblem with that of the previously best known algorithm. Flow accumulation, which models flow of water through a terrain, is one of the most basic hydrologic attributes of a terrain. We present the results of an extensive set of experiments on real-life terrain datasets of different sizes and characteristics. Our experiments show that while our new algorithm scales nicely with dataset size, the previously known algorithm \"breaks down\" once the size of the dataset becomes bigger than the available main memory. For example, while our algorithm computes the flow accumulation for the Appalachian Mountains in about three hours, the previously known algorithm takes several weeks.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100153970", "name": "lars arge"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100415659", "name": "laura toma"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100367555", "name": "jeffrey scott vitter"}], "citations": ["Richard Vuduc , James W.

We experimantally and visually compare\r\nthe performance of PM with the performance of well-known algorithms\r\nand of recent attractive strategies. Experiments are carried out on\r\ndifferent families of randomly generated graphs, on pathological\r\ninstances, and on real test sets. Performance indicators include\r\nboth number of edge crossings and running time, as well as\r\nstructural measures of the problem instances. We found CP to be a\r\nvery interesting and rich problem from a combinatorial point of\r\nview. Our results clearly separate the behavior of the algorithms,\r\nproving the effectiveness of PM on most test sets and showing\r\ntradeoffs between quality of the solutions and running time.\r\nHowever, if the visual complexity of the drawings is considered, we\r\nfound no clear winner.

The algorithm dynamically adjusts both the number of hulls and the number of vertices in each hull to best represent the stream using its fixed-memory budget. This algorithm addresses a problem whose importance is increasingly recognized, namely, the problem of summarizing real-time data streams to enable on-line analytical processing. As a motivating example, consider habitat monitoring using wireless sensor networks. The sensors produce a steady stream of geographic data, namely, the locations of objects being tracked. In order to conserve their limited resources (power, bandwidth, and storage), the sensors can compute, store, and exchange ClusterHull summaries of their data, without losing important geometric information. We are not aware of other schemes specifically designed for capturing shape information in geometric data streams and so we compare ClusterHull with some of the best general-purpose clustering schemes, such as CURE,k-medians, and LSEARCH. We show through experiments that ClusterHull is able to represent the shape of two-dimensional data streams more faithfully and flexibly than the stream versions of these clustering algorithms.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100630389", "name": "john hershberger"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81342511241", "name": "nisheeth shrivastava"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332530356", "name": "subhash suri"}], "citations": ["Daniel Blank, Source selection for image retrieval in peer-to-peer networks, Proceedings of the Third BCS-IRSG conference on Future Directions in Information Access, p.43-49, September 01-01, 2009, Padua, Italy\n"]}, "Article No.: 7": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "1\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "22\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "354\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1412228.1455262", "references": ["Sarita V.

The simplicity and better complexity of the algorithm is achieved via the utilization of two such common synchronization primitives. In this article, we also experimentally evaluate the performance of our algorithm, together with lock-based approaches and a practical, previously previously known algorithm that is based that is based only on read and write primitives. The experimental evaluation is performed on three well-known parallel architectures.

The main idea is that although two values may not be neighborhood substitutable if we consider the whole neighborhood of a given variable, they could be substitutable if we only focus on a part of the neighborhood induced by an orientation of the constraint graph. Directional substitutability provides a mean to decompose value domains into chains of directionally substitutable values that can be attempted simultaneously during search.We report experiments carried out on several binary CSPs which clearly indicate that variations of classical algorithms which exploit directional substitutability often outperform the original algorithms.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81384592664", "name": "wady naanaa"}], "citations": ["Cees Witteveen , Wiebe Van Der Hoek , Nico Roos, Concurrently decomposable constraint systems, Proceedings of the 7th German conference on Multiagent system technologies, September 09-11, 2009, Hamburg, Germany\n", "Wiebe van der Hoek , Cees Witteveen , Michael Wooldridge, Decomposing constraint systems: equivalences and computational properties, The 10th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, May 02-06, 2011, Taipei, Taiwan\n", "L\u00e9on R.

This represents a significant advancement over the (full-)text indexing techniques of the previous decade, whose indexes required several times the size of the text. Although it is relatively new, this algorithmic technology has matured up to a point where theoretical research is giving way to practical developments. Nonetheless this requires significant programming skills, a deep engineering effort, and a strong algorithmic background to dig into the research results. To date only isolated implementations and focused comparisons of compressed indexes have been reported, and they missed a common API, which prevented their re-use or deployment within other applications.The goal of this article is to fill this gap. First, we present the existing implementations of compressed indexes from a practitioner's point of view. Second, we introduce thePizza&Chili;site, which offers tuned implementations and a standardized API for the most successful compressed full-text self-indexes, together with effective test-beds and scripts for their automatic validation and test. Third, we show the results of our extensive experiments on these codes with the aim of demonstrating the practical relevance of this novel algorithmic technology.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100411624", "name": "paolo ferragina"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81388596990", "name": "rodrigo gonzalez"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100113887", "name": "gonzalo navarro"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81327492057", "name": "rossano venturini"}], "citations": ["Hongwei Huo , Longgang Chen , Heng Zhao , Jeffrey Scott Vitter , Yakov Nekrich , Qiang Yu, A data-aware FM-index, Proceedings of the Meeting on Algorithm Engineering & Expermiments, p.10-23, January 05-05, 2015, San Diego, California\n", "Paolo Ferragina , Jouni Sir\u00e9n , Rossano Venturini, Distribution-aware compressed full-text indexes, Proceedings of the 19th European conference on Algorithms, September 05-09, 2011, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany\n", "Simon Gog , Gonzalo Navarro, Improved and Extended Locating Functionality on Compressed Suffix Arrays, Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms, June 29-July 01, 2014\n", "Simon Gog , Timo Beller , Alistair Moffat , Matthias Petri, From Theory to Practice: Plug and Play with Succinct Data Structures, Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms, June 29-July 01, 2014\n", "Gonzalo Navarro , Simon J.

It has been shown that low-weight integral cycle bases have applications in the periodic event scheduling problem and cyclic time tabling. However, no polynomial time algorithm is known for computing a minimum weight integral cycle basis in a given directed graph.We give a necessary condition that has to be satisfied by any minimum weight integral cycle basis and guided by this necessary condition, we propose a new heuristic for constructing a low weight integral cycle basis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to construct integral cycle bases that are not necessarily fundamental. We implemented our heuristic and tested it on random graphs and compared the weight of the integral cycle basis computed by our algorithm with the weight of a minimum cycle basis and the weights of integral cycle bases (these are, in fact, fundamental cycle bases) computed by already existing and new heuristics for this problem. Empirical results suggest that our heuristic performs better than the existing heuristics for this problem and in fact, it computes aminimumweight integral cycle basis on these graphs. (In the above comparison, when the weight of the integral cycle basis computed and the weight of a minimum cycle basis turn out to be equal, it immediately implies that we have in fact found a minimum integral cycle basis.) The time needed for our heuristic is typically a little higher compared to the time taken by the other heuristics that compute fundamental cycle bases.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100468655", "name": "telikepalli kavitha"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413594249", "name": "katakam vamsi krishna"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 3": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "2\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "20\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "3\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "369\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1412228.1412237", "references": ["Agarwal, P.

Among the other algorithms studied are: a na\u00efve approach, a \u201cwalk along a line\u201d strategy, and a trapezoidal decomposition-based search structure. The current implementation addresses general arrangements of planar curves, including arrangements of nonlinear segments (e.g., conic arcs) and allows for degenerate input (for example, more than two curves intersecting in a single point or overlapping curves). The algorithms use exact geometric computation and thus result in the correct point location. In our landmarks algorithm (a.k.a. jump & walk), special points, \u201clandmarks,\u201d are chosen in a preprocessing stage, their place in the arrangement is found, and they are inserted into a data structure that enables efficient nearest-neighbor search. Given a query point, the nearest landmark is located and a \u201cwalk\u201d strategy is applied from the landmark to the query point. We report on various experiments with arrangements composed of line segments or conic arcs. The results indicate that compared to the other algorithms tested, the landmarks approach is the most efficient, when the overall (amortized) cost of a query is taken into account, combining both preprocessing and query time. The simplicity of the algorithm enables an almost straightforward implementation and rather easy maintenance. The generic programming implementation allows versatility both in the selected type of landmarks and in the choice of the nearest-neighbor search structure. The end result is an efficient point-location algorithm that bypasses the alternative CGAL implementations in most practical aspects.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413596264", "name": "idit haran"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81491640532", "name": "dan halperin"}], "citations": ["Michael Hemmer , Ophir Setter , Dan Halperin, Constructing the exact Voronoi diagram of arbitrary lines in three-dimensional space with fast point-location, Proceedings of the 18th annual European conference on Algorithms: Part I, September 06-08, 2010, Liverpool, UK\n", "Michael Hemmer , Michal Kleinbort , Dan Halperin, Improved implementation of point location in general two-dimensional subdivisions, Proceedings of the 20th Annual European conference on Algorithms, p.611-623, September 10-12, 2012, Ljubljana, Slovenia\n"]}, "Article No.: 2": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "16\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "36\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "2\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "614\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1412228.1412236", "references": ["Agarwal, P.

This article formulates the reaction mapping problem as an optimization problem. The problem is shown to be NP-Complete for general graphs. Five algorithms based on canonical graph naming and enumerative combinatoric techniques are developed to solve the problem. Unlike previous formulations based on limited configurations or classifications, our algorithms are uniquely capable of mapping any reaction that can be represented as a set of chemical graphs optimally. This is due to the direct use of Graph Isomorphism as the basis for these algorithms as opposed to the more commonly used Maximum Common Subgraph.

We describe optimizations to the algorithm of Apostolico et al. that significantly reduce both its running time and its memory consumption. We also correct an error in this algorithm. In addition, we show how to restructure and simplify Valiente's algorithm, allowing us to remove redundant computations from the algorithm resulting in much improved performance. Moreover, in the case of both algorithms, when the density of the circle graph's associated interval representation is increased beyond a certain point the efficacy of the optimizations we apply increases dramatically and as a function of the density.

Broadcasting schemes that are based on windows scheduling algorithms provide a way to satisfy all requests with both low bandwidth and low latency.Consider a system ofnpages that need to be scheduled (transmitted) on identical channels an infinite number of times. Time is slotted, and it takes one time slot to transmit each page. In thewindows scheduling problem(WS) each pagei, 1 \u2264i\u2264n, is associated with arequest window wi. In a feasible schedule for WS, pageimust be scheduled at least once in any window ofwitime slots. The objective function is to minimize the number of channels required to schedule all the pages.The main contribution of this paper is the design of a generalbuffer schemefor the windows scheduling problem such thatanyalgorithm for WS follows this scheme. As a result, this scheme can serve as a tool to analyze and/or exhaust all possible WS-algorithms.The buffer scheme is based on modelling the system as a nondeterministic finite state machine in which any directed cycle corresponds to a legal schedule and vice-versa. Since WS is NP-hard, we present some heuristics and pruning-rules for cycle detection that ensure reasonable cycle-search time.By introducing various rules, the buffer scheme can be transformed into deterministic scheduling algorithms. We show that a simple page-selection rule for the buffer scheme provides an optimal schedule to WS for the case where all thewi's have divisible sizes, and other good schedules for some other general cases. By using an exhaustive-search, we prove impossibility results for other important instances.We also show how to extend the buffer scheme to more generalized environments in which (i) pages are arriving and departing on-line, (ii) the window constraint has somejitter, and (iii) different pages might have different lengths.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100242368", "name": "amotz bar-noy"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100297556", "name": "richard e ladner"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413592305", "name": "jacob christensen"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100602991", "name": "tami tamir"}], "citations": []}}}}, "Volume1,": {"Issue1": {"date": {"year": "1996", "month": 0}, "articles": {"Article No.: 4": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "49\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "40\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "475\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/235141.235145", "references": ["A.

A standard simple heuristic, Bottom-Left-Decreasing (BLD), has been shown to perform quite well in practice. We introduce and demonstrate the effectiveness of BLD&ast;, a stochastic search variation of BLD. While BLD places the rectangles in decreasing order of height, width, area, and perimeter, BLD&ast; successively tries random orderings, chosen from a distribution determined by their Kendall-tau distance from one of these fixed orderings. Our experiments on benchmark problems show that BLD&ast; produces significantly better packings than BLD after only 1 min of computation. Furthermore, we also show that BLD&ast; outperforms recently reported metaheuristics. Furthermore, we observe that people seem able to reason about packing problems extremely well. We incorporate our new algorithms in an interactive system that combines the advantages of computer speed and human reasoning. Using the interactive system, we are able to quickly produce significantly better solutions than BLD&ast; by itself.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100469781", "name": "n lesh"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100484340", "name": "j marks"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100337339", "name": "a mcmahon"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100154521", "name": "m mitzenmacher"}], "citations": ["I.

We investigate reduction of the search space while simultaneously retaining data structures, created during a preprocessing phase, of size linear (i.e., optimal) to the size of the graph. We show that the search space of Dijkstra's algorithm can be significantly reduced by extracting geometric information from a given layout of the graph and by encapsulating precomputed shortest-path information in resulted geometric objects (containers). We present an extensive experimental study comparing the impact of different types of geometric containers using test data from real-world traffic networks. We also present new algorithms as well as an empirical study for the dynamic case of this problem, where edge weights are subject to change and the geometric containers have to be updated and show that our new methods are two to three times faster than recomputing everything from scratch. Finally, in an appendix, we discuss the software framework that we developed to realize the implementations of all of our variants of Dijkstra's algorithm. Such a framework is not trivial to achieve as our goal was to maintain a common code base that is, at the same time, small, efficient, and flexible, as we wanted to enhance and combine several variants in any possible way.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100168505", "name": "dorothea wagner"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100540090", "name": "thomas willhalm"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100121089", "name": "christos zaroliagis"}], "citations": ["Giacomo Nannicini , Daniel Delling , Leo Liberti , Dominik Schultes, Bidirectional A* search for time-dependent fast paths, Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Experimental algorithms, p.334-346, May 30-June 01, 2008, Provincetown, MA, USA\n", "Songhua Xing , Cyrus Shahabi , Bei Pan, Continuous monitoring of nearest neighbors on land surface, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, v.2 n.1, August 2009\n", "Daniel Delling , Dorothea Wagner, Landmark-based routing in dynamic graphs, Proceedings of the 6th international conference on Experimental algorithms, June 06-08, 2007, Rome, Italy\n", "Reinhard Bauer , Tobias Columbus , Bastian Katz , Marcus Krug , Dorothea Wagner, Preprocessing speed-up techniques is hard, Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Algorithms and Complexity, May 26-28, 2010, Rome, Italy\n", "Reinhard Bauer , Daniel Delling , Peter Sanders , Dennis Schieferdecker , Dominik Schultes , Dorothea Wagner, Combining hierarchical and goal-directed speed-up techniques for Dijkstra's algorithm, Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Experimental algorithms, p.303-318, May 30-June 01, 2008, Provincetown, MA, USA\n", "Gianlorenzo D'Angelo , Mattia D'Emidio , Daniele Frigioni , Camillo Vitale, Fully dynamic maintenance of arc-flags in road networks, Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Experimental Algorithms, June 07-09, 2012, Bordeaux, France\n", "Evangelia Pyrga , Frank Schulz , Dorothea Wagner , Christos Zaroliagis, Efficient models for timetable information in public transportation systems, Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), 12, 2008\n", "Gianlorenzo D'Angelo , Daniele Frigioni , Camillo Vitale, Dynamic arc-flags in road networks, Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Experimental algorithms, May 05-07, 2011, Crete, Greece\n", "Rolf H.

While, in general, any algorithm might benefit from compressed data because of reduced paging requirements, we identified two natural candidates that would further benefit from order-preserving compression, namely string-oriented sorting algorithms and word-RAM algorithms for keys of bounded length. The word-RAM model has some of the fastest known sorting algorithms in practice. These algorithms are designed for keys of bounded length, usually 32 or 64 bits, which limits their direct applicability for strings. One possibility is to use an order-preserving compression scheme, so that a bounded-key-length algorithm can be applied. For the case of standard algorithms, we took what is considered to be the among the fastest nonword RAM string sorting algorithms, Fast MKQSort, and measured its performance on compressed data. The Fast MKQSort algorithm of Bentley and Sedgewick is optimized to handle text strings. Our experiments show that order-compression techniques results in savings of approximately 15&percnt; over the same algorithm on noncompressed data. For the word-RAM, we modified Andersson's sorting algorithm to handle variable-length keys. The resulting algorithm is faster than the standard Unix sort by a factor of 1.5X. Last, we used an order-preserving scheme that is within a constant additive term of the optimal Hu--Tucker, but requires linear time rather thanO(mlogm), wherem&equals; &verbar;\u03a3&verbar; is the size of the alphabet.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100502989", "name": "alejandro lopez-ortiz"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81413598371", "name": "mehdi mirzazadeh"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100537109", "name": "mohammad ali safari"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81320494819", "name": "hossein sheikhattar"}], "citations": ["Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee , Lipyeow Lim , Timothy Malkemus , George Mihaila , Kenneth Ross , Sherman Lau , Cathy McArthur , Zoltan Toth , Reza Sherkat, Efficient index compression in DB2 LUW, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, v.2 n.2, August 2009\n"]}, "Article No.: 2.9": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "3\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "35\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "7\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "939\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1064546.1180621", "references": ["D.

Given a graphG&equals; (V,E) and positive-integral vertex weightsw:V\u2192N, theinterval-coloringproblem seeks to find an assignment of a real intervalI(u) to each vertexu\u2208V, such that two constraints are satisfied: (i) for every vertexu\u2208V, &verbar;I(u)&verbar; &equals;w(u) and (ii) for every pair of adjacent verticesuandv,I(u)\u2229I(v) &equals; \u2205. The goal is to minimize thespan&verbar;\u222av\u2208VI(v)&verbar;. Themax-coloring problemseeks to find a proper vertex coloring ofGwhose color classesC1C2, \u2026,Ck, minimize the sum of the weights of the heaviest vertices in the color classes, that is, \u2211ki&equals; 1maxv&epsi;Ciw(v). Both problems arise in efficient memory allocation for programs. The interval-coloring problem models the compile-time memory allocation problem and has a rich history dating back at least to the 1970s. The max-coloring problem arises in minimizing the total buffer size needed by a dedicated memory manager for programs. In another application, this problem models scheduling of conflicting jobs in batches to minimize themakespan. Both problems are NP-complete even for interval graphs, although there are constant-factor approximation algorithms for both problems on interval graphs. In this paper, we consider these problems forchordal graphs, a subclass of perfect graphs. These graphs naturally generalize interval graphs and can be defined as the class of graphs that have no induced cycle of length >3. Recently, a 4-approximation algorithm (which we call GeomFit) has been presented for the max-coloring problem on perfect graphs (Pemmaraju and Raman 2005). This algorithm can be used to obtain an interval coloring as well, but without the constant-factor approximation guarantee. In fact, there is no known constant-factor approximation algorithm for the interval-coloring problem on perfect graphs. We study the performance of GeomFit and several simpleO(log(n))-factor approximation algorithms for both problems. We experimentally evaluate and compare four simple heuristics: first-fit, best-fit, GeomFit, and a heuristic based on partitioning the graph into vertex sets of similar weight. Both for max-coloring and for interval coloring, GeomFit deviates from OPT by about 1.5&percnt;, on average. The performance of first-fit comes close second, deviating from OPT by less than 6&percnt;, on average, for both problems. Best-fit comes third and graph-partitioning heuristic comes a distant last. Our basic data comes from about 10,000 runs of each of the heuristics for each of the two problems on randomly generated chordal graphs of various sizes, sparsity, and structure.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100583465", "name": "sriram v pemmaraju"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81320494017", "name": "sriram penumatcha"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548725156", "name": "rajiv raman"}], "citations": ["Mathieu Bouchard , Mirjana angalovi\u0107 , Alain Hertz, About equivalent interval colorings of weighted graphs, Discrete Applied Mathematics, v.157 n.17, p.3615-3624, October, 2009\n", "Lian Li , Quan Hoang Nguyen , Jingling Xue, Scratchpad allocation for data aggregates in superperfect graphs, ACM SIGPLAN Notices, v.42 n.7, July 2007\n", "Leah Epstein , Asaf Levin, On the max coloring problem, Theoretical Computer Science, 462, p.23-38, November, 2012\n", "Lian Li , Jingling Xue , Jens Knoop, Scratchpad memory allocation for data aggregates via interval coloring in superperfect graphs, ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS), v.10 n.2, p.1-42, December 2010\n"]}, "Article No.: 2.7": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "2\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "8\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "1\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "404\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/1064546.1180618", "references": ["Adel Ahmed , Tim Dwyer , Michael Forster , Xiaoyan Fu , Joshua Ho , Seok-Hee Hong , Dirk Kosch\u00fctzki , Colin Murray , Nikola S.

This technique permits searching for the approximate occurrences of a pattern of lengthmin a text of lengthnin timeO(\u2308m/w\u2309n), wherewis the number of bits in the computer word. Although this is asymptotically the optimal bit-parallel speedup over the basicO(mn) time algorithm, it wastes bit-parallelism's power in the common case wheremis much smaller thanw, sincew\u2212mbits in the computer words are unused. In this paper, we explore different ways to increase the bit-parallelism when the search pattern is short. First, we show how multiple patterns can be packed into a single computer word so as to search for all them simultaneously. Instead of spendingO(rn) time to search forrpatterns of lengthm\u2264w/2, we needO(\u2308rm/w\u2309n) time. Second, we show how the mechanism permits boosting the search for a single pattern of lengthm\u2264w/2, which can be searched for inO(\u2308n/\u230aw/m\u230b\u2309) bit-parallel steps instead ofO(n). Third, we show how to extend these algorithms so that the time bounds essentially depend onkinstead ofm, wherekis the maximum number of differences permitted. Finally, we show how the ideas can be applied to other problems such as multiple exact string matching and one-against-all computation of edit distance and longest common subsequences. Our experimental results show that the new algorithms work well in practice, obtaining significant speedups over the best existing alternatives, especially on short patterns and moderate number of differences allowed.

This problem is classically solved by Dijkstra's algorithm. Many techniques are known to speed up this algorithm heuristically, while optimality of the solution can still be guaranteed. In most studies, such techniques are considered individually. The focus of our work iscombinationof speed-up techniques for Dijkstra's algorithm. We consider all possible combinations of four known techniques, namely,goal-directed search,bidirectional search,multilevel approach, andshortest-path containers, and show how these can be implemented. In an extensive experimental study, we compare the performance of the various combinations and analyze how the techniques harmonize when jointly applied.

This involves finding large subsets of a group satisfying the Triple Product Property (TPP) as a means to bound the exponent of matrix multiplication. Recently, Hedtke and Murthy discussed several methods to find TPP triples. Because the search space for subset triples is too large, it is only possible to focus on subgroup triples. We present methods to upgrade a given TPP triple to a bigger TPP triple. If no upgrade is possible, we use reduction methods (based on random experiments and heuristics) to create a smaller TPP triple that can be used as input for the upgrade methods. If we apply the upgrade process for subset triples after one step with the upgrade method for subgroup triples for the known maximal subgroup TPP triples in groups of order up to 1,000, we achieve an enlargement of the triple size of 100&percnt; in the best case.

Testing whether a graph allows such a drawing is known to be NP-complete, and while the problem is polynomial-time solvable for special graph classes, there is not much known about solving the problem forgeneralgraphsin practice. The only attempt so far has been a branch-and-bound algorithm over the graph\u2019s triconnectivity structure, which was able to solve small graphs. Furthermore, there are some known FPT algorithms to deal with the problem.In this article, we propose two fundamentally different approaches based on the seemingly novel concept ofordered embeddingsand on the concept of aHanani-Tutte-type characterizationof monotone drawings. In both approaches, we model the problem as special SAT instances, that is, logic formulae for which we check satisfiability. Solving these SAT instances allows us to decide upward planarity for arbitrary graphs.For the first time, we give an extensive experimental comparison between virtually all known approaches to the problem. To this end, we also investigate implementation issues and different variants of the known algorithms as well as of our SAT approaches and evaluate all algorithms on real-world as well as on constructed instances. We also give a detailed performance study of the novel SAT approaches. We show that the SAT formulations outperform all known approaches for graphs with up to 400 edges. For even larger graphs, a modified branch-and-bound algorithm becomes competitive.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100362708", "name": "markus chimani"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488669015", "name": "robert zeranski"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 1.3": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "205\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "6\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "205\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2699878", "references": ["Charu C.

In this article, we study batch algorithms for maintaining asingle-source shortest-path treein graphs with positive real edge weights. In particular, we focus our attention onhomogeneousbatches, that is, eitherincremental(containing only edge insertion and weight decrease operations) ordecremental(containing only edge deletion and weight increase operations) batches, which model realistic dynamic scenarios like transient vertex failures in communication networks and traffic congestion/decongestion phenomena in road networks.We propose two new algorithms to process either incremental or decremental batches, respectively, and a combination of these two algorithms that is able to process arbitrary sequences of incremental and decremental batches. All these algorithms areupdate sensitive; namely, they are efficient with respect to the number of vertices in the shortest-path tree that change their parents and/or their distances from the source as a consequence of a batch. This makes unfeasible an effective comparison on a theoretical basis of our new algorithms with the solutions known in the literature, which in turn are analyzed with respect to others and different parameters. For this reason, in order to evaluate the quality of our approach, we provide also an extensive experimental study including our new algorithms and the most efficient previous batch algorithms. Our experimental results complement previous studies and show that the various solutions can be consistently ranked on the basis of the type of homogeneous batch and of the underlying network. As a result, our work can be helpful in selecting a proper solution depending on the specific application scenario.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81548013296", "name": "annalisa dandrea"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81488670377", "name": "mattia demidio"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100541516", "name": "daniele frigioni"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81479661335", "name": "stefano leucci"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100248430", "name": "guido proietti"}], "citations": []}, "Article No.: 1.6": {"Metrics": {"Citation Count": "0\n", "Downloads (12 months)": "99\n", "Downloads (6 weeks) ": "5\n", "Downloads (cumulative)": "99\n"}, "doi": "doi>10.1145/2780652", "references": ["Aaron B.

It is for instance used to provide bounds on the expected stretch of greedy-routing algorithms in Internet-like graphs. However, the best-known theoretical algorithm computing this parameter runs inO(n3.69) time, which is prohibitive for large-scale graphs.In this article, we propose an algorithm for determining the hyperbolicity of graphs with tens of thousands of nodes. Its running time depends on the distribution of distances and on the actual value of the hyperbolicity. Although its worst case runtime isO(n4), it is in practice much faster than previous proposals as observed in our experimentations. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithm that can be used on graphs with millions of nodes.

Clique counting is essential in a variety of applications, including social network analysis. Our algorithms make it possible to computeqkfor several real-world graphs and shed light on its growth rate as a function ofk. Even for small values ofk, the numberqkofk-cliques can be in the order of tens or hundreds of trillions. Askincreases, different graph instances show different behaviors: while on some graphsqk+ 1<qk, on other benchmarksqk+ 1\u00bbqk, up to two orders of magnitude in our observations. Graphs with steep clique growth rates represent particularly tough instances in practice.Due to the computationally intensive nature of the clique counting problem, we settle for parallel solutions in the MapReduce framework, which has become in the last few years a de facto standard for batch processing of massive datasets. We give both theoretical and experimental contributions.On the theory side, we design the first exact scalable algorithm for counting (and listing)k-cliques in MapReduce. Our algorithm usesO(m3/2) total space andO(mk/2) work, wheremis the number of graph edges. This matches the best-known bounds for triangle listing whenk&equals; 3 and is work optimal in the worst case for anyk, while keeping the communication cost independent ofk. We also design sampling-based estimators that can dramatically reduce the running time and space requirements of the exact approach, while providing very accurate solutions with high probability.We then assess the effectiveness of different clique counting approaches through an extensive experimental analysis over the Amazon EC2 platform, considering both our algorithms and their state-of-the-art competitors. The experimental results clearly highlight the algorithm of choice in different scenarios and prove our exact approach to be the most effective when the number ofk-cliques is large, gracefully scaling to nontrivial values ofkeven on clusters of small/medium size. Our approximation algorithms achieve extremely accurate estimates and large speedups, especially on the toughest instances for the exact algorithms.", "authors": [{"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100246662", "name": "irene finocchi"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=99658755754", "name": "marco finocchi"}, {"link": "http://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81361607526", "name": "emanuele g fusco"}], "citations": []}}}}}}}
